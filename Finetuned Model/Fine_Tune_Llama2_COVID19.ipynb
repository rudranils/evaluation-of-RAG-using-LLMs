If periodontal disease is not treated, it can cause brain abscesses as well as cardiovascular disease and some cancers. The survival of this individual may have been down to extraordinary luck, but the use of antibacterial plants may well have saved them. There is abundant evidence for dental problems throughout the archeological record and attempts at treating these currently represent the earliest evidence for invasive medical treatment. From Homo habilis (2.4-1.6 million years) onwards, there are many examples of interproximal grooves, or deep scratches in teeth that have been interpreted as evidence for tooth picking (Ungar et al. 2001; Gracia-T\\u00e9llez et al. 2013; Lozano et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2014) . This is supported by the presence of non-edible wood fragments, recovered from the dental calculus of Paleolithic individuals in association with interproximal grooves from the 1.2-million-year-old hominin from Sima del Elefante, Spain , and an example from a 49,000-year-old Neanderthal from El Sidr\\u00f3n, Spain (Hardy et al. 2012) . Here, the wood fragment was found adjacent to evidence for a tooth abscess (Radini et al. 2016) . A Neanderthal individual from the site of Krapina in Croatia, and dated to around 130,000 years ago, has evidence for interproximal grooves as well as dental probing on several teeth. These are thought to be linked to the evident dental problems including rotation and fractures, seen in the teeth of this individual (Frayer et al. 2017) . Further evidence for dental treatment can be found in the Late Upper Paleolithic where scraping inside a dental carious lesion, suggesting invasive treatment, was identified in a skeleton dating to around 14,000 years ago (Oxilia et al. 2015) .One of the best-known groups of Neanderthals to display evidence for survival following trauma is from Shanidar, Iran, where four individuals some of relatively advanced age, and dated to between 65,000 and 35,000 years ago, had suffered a range of injuries from which they had recovered and lived, sometimes for several years, with little obvious after-effects of infection (Trinkaus and Zimmerman 1982) . It is unlikely this could have occurred without use of antibacterial plants. Near the graves at Shanidar, clusters of pollen from several plants, including a member of the genus Ephedra, Ephedraceae, identified as having significant medicinal properties, led to the suggestion that these had been deliberately placed (Solecki 1975; Leroi-Gourhan 1975) ; however, whether the plants were intentionally deposited is doubtful as it could be due to rodent activity (Sommer 1999) . Of the bioactive alkaloids found in Ephedra (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common is ephedrine (1); these ephedrinetype alkaloids are responsible for the stimulant and thermogenic effects of the crude drug, which also included antioxidant and antimicrobial properties (Elhadef et al. 2020 ).Surgical procedures from which individuals have recovered, including amputation and trepanation, are relatively common in later prehistory. The earliest known healed trepanation was detected on a 50-year-old male from the site of Vasilyevka II, Ukraine, and dates to the Mesolithic (late hunter gatherer) period around 8020-7620 years ago (7300-6220 BC) (Lillie 1998) while further examples from the subsequent Neolithic period have been recorded (Alt et al. 1997) . A well-healed double skull trepanation on an individual from Italy, dated to 5000 years ago, is thought to have been conducted to treat chronic osteomyelitis (Petrone et al. 2015) . Altogether, there are approximately 1500 examples of trepanation in the prehistoric archeological record (Faria 2015) . Most of these are found in Andean South America where over 1000 examples have been identified (Verano 2003) . Currently, the oldest known example of an individual who survived amputation of the left arm, as demonstrated by healed cicatrices, is from the Neolithic site of Buthiers-Boulancourt, France, almost 7000 years ago (4900-4700 BC) (Verano et al. 2000; Buquet-Marcon et al. 2007 ). The evident complexity of some surgical procedures and the many examples of healing after trauma and overcoming infections suggests a mastery in the use of medicinal plants.As well as the pain these would cause, any form of injury, from a broken bone to a small']\",\n          \"[\\\"\\\\nDear Editor,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are reported to prevent Covid-19 in 94-95% of adults after a two-dose regimen [1, 2] . However, the immunogenicity in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is currently unknown.As a result of lifelong immunosuppressive treatment, SOT recipients are at a higher risk of severe infections, including Covid-19 [3, 4] .The immunosuppressive treatment affects both the humoral and cellular immune responses with an expected reduced immune response to the Covid-19 vaccine in SOT recipients, as has been previously observed following influenza and pneumococcal vaccination [5, 6] . Previous studies have shown that SOT recipients have a decreased or no immune response following Covid-19 infection [3, 7, 8] . In addition, less than 17% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine was administrated, which increased to 54%, weeks following the second vaccine dose [9, 10 , 11] . It is currently not well described if a twodose regimen of a Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient to elicit an immune response in SOT recipients.Our aim was to investigate the cellular and humoral immune response in SOT recipients following a two-dose regimen of Covid-19 vaccination.All SOT recipients (\\u226518 years of age) from the Region of Southern Denmark were invited to participate in the study since 29 January 2021 (Danish Ethical Committee, record no. 77786). All the participants received vaccination as part of the national Covid-19 vaccination program and the SOT recipients were identified as a prioritized target group.Blood samples were drawn 6 weeks following the second vaccination. The SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 IgG response was measured by a semiquantitative EUROIMMUN SARS-COV-2 ELISA assay (FDA approved). Test results were interpreted according to the manufacturer; ratios \\u22640.8 were interpreted as negative, 0.8 to <1.1 as borderline, and \\u22651.1 as positive. For this study, values >0.8 were reported as positive. T-cell response was measured by the interferon-\\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot Qiagen QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay (research use only), which includes specific SARS-CoV-2 peptides pool from spike antigen (S1 and S2 subunits). The cut-off for a positive response was set at 0.15 (personal communication with Qiagen).Categorical data was described by total and percentages. Data comparisons were made using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Continuous variables were described as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. A p-value of less than 0.05 (5%) was considered statistically significant.A total of 663 SOT recipients were identified and 423 consented to be included in the study. We report the preliminary results of the humoral and cellular immune responses in our ongoing study including the first 80 SOT recipients, who completed the two-dose vaccine regimen. All but one SOT recipient received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine (n = 79).The median age was 58.9 years (IQR: 47.9-66.8) with 55.0% (44/80) being males. The majority of SOT recipients were kidney transplant recipients (65.0%).The median time from second vaccination to antibody testing was 5.6 weeks (IQR 5.1-6.3). The median IgG antibody response was 0.3 (IQR 0.2-2.7). The QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay was positive in five (6.3%) SOT recipients. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics stratified by SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG immune response. Only 35.0% (n = 28) were able to mount a positive IgG immune response 6 weeks after the second dose of vaccine (Fig. 1) . Vaccine responders were significantly younger than non-responders (p < 0.01). All SOT recipients were treated with a combination of at least two immunosuppressive drugs. A total of 61 SOT recipients received proliferation inhibitors and the proportion of non-responders was significantly higher in this group (p < 0.01). Covid-19 infection was not diagnosed in any of the SOT recipients before or after vaccination.This study provides insights into the limitations of immunization following a two-dose regimen of Covid-19 mRNA vaccine in SOT recipients. The key finding was a reduced antibody response 6 weeks after the second vaccination, with only 35% of\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\" two main optimization criteria are the accuracy of the prediction and the time inferred to obtain the solution ever more tailored solutions building on CNNs are being developed recently. Architectures such as VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) and ResNet (He et al. 2015a) for image classification and Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) and SSD (Liu et al. 2016 ) for object detection have proven to provide good accuracy at resonable inference time.CV is utilized for infrastructure inspection in many application domains. The typical challenges addressed with CV in this area are cases where large amounts of physical objects are to be inspected and they are geographically remote and / or dispersed. Selected research articles are presented in the following and summarized in Table 1. A major application area is road surface inspection and maintenance. Roads in bad condition can ultimately result in more accidents and higher costs (Baladi et al. 2017; Gleave et al. 2014) . Thus, CV is utilized to automatically assess road surface condition and derive necessary maintenance actions. Over the last years this became possible without expensive, specialized hardware (compare, e.g., Quintana et al. 2016) . Chatterjee et al. (2018) show how machine learning-based CV can be used to detect road surface cracks and develop a ''vision-based DSS for crack detection''. They offer first insights into a nascent design theory for the application case of road crack detection on the basis of images.Not only roads, but also railways need to be inspected periodically to ensure safe transports. Wei et al. (2019) employ a Faster R-CNN to detect defects of railway track fasteners. Gibert et al. (2017) propose a CNN-based multitask learning approach that detects railway track fasteners and crossties and classifies the state of these components.Wind turbine blades are another physical object of interest for CV-based infrastructure inspection. Akhloufi and Benmesbah (2014) present a CV approach to identify ice accreation on wind turbine blades. Ice accreation can require a maintenance action since it can cause malfunction and premature wear and is a safety hazard for nearby people and infrastructure like roads and powerlines. Shihavuddin et al. (2019) show how faults like leading edge erosion can be detected with a Faster R-CNN on wind turbine blades.In this work, we are particularly interested in CV solutions for power line inspection relying on UAV images. From a component-based view, power line inspection can be divided into four major categories: towers or poles, insulators, conductors, and fittings (Liu et al. 2020) . Each of these categories contains several subcomponents (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) that typically vary in size, kind, and material according to the voltage level. For instance, some part of a distribution network with low voltage might have wooden poles, small standing insulators, and a single, relatively thin conductor. On the other hand, transmission networks usually have lattice steel towers, large suspending insulators, and thicker conductors. Several studies have been published that utilize various potential platforms (e.g., helicopter, satellite, and UAV) to collect different data types (e.g., optical images, laser scanner data, thermal images, and synthetic aperture radar images) and analyzed these (Matikainen et al. 2016) . The vision-based approach -with image data from the visible spectrum captured by UAVs and automatically analyzed through image processing capabilities -has gained the most attention and traction in the power line inspection research domain (Liu et al. 2020) . With a few exceptions, automated vision-based power line inspection based on UAV-captured images requires two inherently related tasks (Liu et al. 2020) : component detection and localization as well as fault diagnosis. The exceptions relate to objects such as bird nests, whose detection already represents a fault. Previous research applying image processing for the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs is numerous (Mirall\\u00e8s et al. 2014) . Liu et al. (2020) identify several characteristics and shortcomings of previous studies using UAV-captured images in their exhaustive literature review. Most studies in the field of vision-based inspection of power lines focus on the insulator and its faults (Liu et al. 2020 ) -mainly missing caps (e.g., Sampedro P\\u00e9rez et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019; Zhai et al. 2018 ) -while little attention has been paid to other components. The safety pin that prevents other components from loosening and falling is the smallest object in the power line and has, despite its importance, received little attention and has only been regarded in fault diagnosis but not in the detection step. Finally, both Liu et al. (2020) and Nguyen et al. (2018) conclude that the mediocre performance of task-specific approaches presented in the vast majority of studies has been superseded by DL approaches that have improved\\\", '-increasing need for maintaining the impeccable condition of power lines, and consequently the reliability of electricity supply. We do so by utilizing available technological possibilities for holistic vision-based applications to provide decision support in scoping and planning maintenance orders for maintenance engineers through improved data and information quality. We focus on addressing this need by answering the following research question (RQ):How can an automated, efficient, and useful visionbased power line maintenance decision support system be designed?By answering this question, we unlock the still largely unregarded and nascent problem class of image-based decision support systems, which we believe to be the higher level abstraction for our specific vision-based power line maintenance decision support system. In particular, following the dual mission of design science research of developing usable artifacts for practice and generating theoretical knowledge for the knowledge base (Gregor and Jones 2007) , we initially explore the challenges and issues of power line maintenance to derive a number of design requirements for image-based decision support systems. Subsequently, we conceptualize design principles based on justificatory knowledge from image processing and deep learning. Based on these design principles, we obtain a number of design features to be used as our application domain specific design for the image-based decision support system for vision-based maintenance of power line components. We instantiate these design features into a concrete artifact that allows us to rigorously evaluate the proposed design knowledge in practice.The remainder of this work is structured as follows: Sect. 2 summarizes the existing relevant literature. Next, in Sect. 3, we introduce the research methodology. In Sect. 4, we conceptualize our design knowledge for image-based decision support systems, before we introduce the developed artifact as well as its various evaluations in Sect. 5. Finally, in Sect. 6, we discuss our research findings, reflect on the limitations of our work, and provide an outlook for future studies.To determine the potential of extensively captured images of power line components (PLCs), we review related work and the literature background in several fields. First, we briefly introduce foundations regarding deep learning (DL) Sect. 2.1. In Sect. 2.2, we present how computer vision (CV) is used for infrastructure inspection in different application domains. Subsequently, in Sect. 2.3, we present related work regarding automated vision-based power line inspection using UAV-captured images. Afterwards, in Sect. 2.4, we examine image-based decision support systems (IB-DSS) as a way to harness images in efficient decision-making. We conclude this section by synthesizing the presented literature and depicting our research gap in Sect. 2.5.Within the past decade, machine learning has shown significant results solving complex problems -both in theory as well as in application within industry (Brynjolfsson and Mcafee 2017) . Especially in the field of DL, 2 a family of algorithms solely based on artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers, the developments grew rapidly (Bharati and Pramanik 2020) .DL overcomes a general limitation of machine learning to handcraft appropriate features in order to find and learn patterns in input data. The advanced architecture gives DL the capability to automate feature learning and consequently reduce human effort (Janiesch et al. 2021 ). Hence, DL is able to better deal with large-scale, noisy, and unstructured data.The exact amount and size of layers is a design choice such that ideal architecture for a given problem and its data must be found through experimentation (Goodfellow et al. 2016) . Each layer is subject to learning and computes nonlinear input-output mappings which enables a DL model to represent extremely intricate functions of its input (LeCun et al. 2015) .Due to these capabilities, DL has brought breakthroughs in processing images, videos and audio like speech (LeCun et al. 2015) . In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) a class of DL algorithms which excel at learning hierarchical features (Janiesch et al. 2021) , are especially suited for the application to feature-rich data -like images. Therefore, DL is a promising candidate for applications within the field of CV.CV aims to equip computers with visual perception skills similar to the human ones (Szeliski 2010) . CV models based on DL have led to a significant increase in performance -DL models have even been proven to surpass human-level performance for specific applications (He et al. 2015b) . Typically, four different CV tasks are distinguished on static images (Griebel et al. 2019) : in image classification the whole image is assigned a class label. Object detection additionally outputs an approximate location of the object of interest. Semantic segmentation produces even more fine-granular information, as each pixel is assigned a class label. In the specific case of instance segmentation, neighboring objects of the same class are distinguished additionally.In the past years, several specific architectures have been developed to allow for these different CV tasks.
