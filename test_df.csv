The RT-PCR test, in which viral nucleic acid is detected, is accepted as the gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. 3 It is reported that COVID-19 infection can be examined in 3 stages, including the first asymptomatic period, secondly the upper and lower respiratory tract response, and then widespread lung involvement that can progress to ARDS. 4 In the COVID-19 disease, approximately 80% of the patients are asymptomatic or limited to mild to moderate symptoms in the first two stages; It is reported that in the remaining 15-20% of the patients, pulmonary ground glass opacity-consolidation is detected as a radiological finding due to the inflammatory response in the lung. 4 If there is no risk factor for the progression of the disease in patients with mild clinical symptoms suspicious for COVID-19, there is no imaging indication, and imaging should be performed in cases with worsening respiratory system symptoms; It has been reported that imaging can be performed to provide medical triage in cases with high suspicion for COVID-19 with moderate-to-severe symptoms if clinical conditions require it. 5 A normal chest X-ray does not exclude COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in cases with mild pneumonia or in the early stage of the disease. 5, 6 It has been reported that CT cannot be used .

1,What effect does IL-1β have on the adhesion of A549 cells to the PMC monolayer?,"['RA (Figure 6(h) ). As shown in Figure 6 (i), IL-1β strongly enhanced the adhesion of A549 cells to the PMC monolayer, while IL-1RA abrogated the adhesion capability. As indicated in the Western blot results in Figure 6 (j), IL-1β increased the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, whereas it had no effect on E-cadherin. IL-1RA had the opposite effect on EMT markers compared with IL-1β.In previous studies, we reported that the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a could enhance the homing of nonclassical monocytes to the pleural cavity by the chemokine axis in The protein levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin were detected by Western blot (n = 3). *Versus. control group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. # Versus C5a group, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01. & Versus C5aRA group, & p < 0.05, && p < 0.01 tuberculosis pleural effusion (TPE). 21 In the present study, we extended our previous work and demonstrated that the activation of C5a in MPE induced the recruitment of intermediate monocytes and played an essential role in the progression of MPE.In the context of cancer, complement C3a and C5a, which leads to tumor-promoting chronic inflammation in the majority of the studied mouse models, are continually generated. 23 However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of the complement system, especially C3a and C5a, in MPE remain unknown. In the present study, we observed activation of the classical and alternative pathways, while little presence of the MBL pathway in malignant pleurisy tissue (Figure 2) , which is different from tuberculous pleurisy. 21 Li et al. elucidated an unknown feature of MBL function in suppressing tumor development. 24 Consistent with their results, we also detected no MBL expression in MPE, indicating that in advanced tumors, low or even no MBL expression is favorable to tumor development and promotes tumor growth. Considering the differential activation of the complement pathway in MPE and TPE, the expressions of complement factors in pleural effusion might be a promising diagnostic marker. In the present study, we detected high activation of C5a and low levels of C3a, both by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Our data were consistent with those reported by Bulla and colleagues, 15 which revealed a strong signal for C1q in lung adenocarcinoma and mild expression of C3. Thus, the activation of the classical and alternative pathways is increased in MPE and may be responsible for the high level of C5a. Because C5a is a strong chemoattractant for inflammatory cells, the major focus of this study was to explore the role of C5a and monocytes in MPE progression.Emerging evidence indicates that monocytes contribute to carcinogenesis by releasing inflammatory mediators. 25 Wang et al. reported that the CD163 + CD14 + and CD206 + CD14 + cell frequencies in MPE were markedly higher than those in benign pleural effusion, and these CD14 positive cells could potentially be used as an immune diagnostic marker for MPE. 26, 27 However, the authors did not analyze the subtype of monocytes in MPE. In agreement with Wang et al. our data also revealed that the portion of monocytes was higher in MPE, showing significant increases compared to those in the blood (Figure 1(a),(b) ). In addition, we demonstrated that CD14 ++ CD16 À classical monocytes were decreased in malignant pleurisy patients, while CD14 + CD16 + nonclassical and CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes were significantly increased in MPE, which was different from the observations in TPE. 21 Interestingly, the proportion of CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes in MPE was 12 times higher than that in peripheral blood (Figure 1(c) , (d)). However, it is unclear how these accumulating intermediate monocytes enter the pleural cavity and whether they promote the progression of MPE.Monocytes were found to be recruited by complement C5a through the increased secretion of chemokines, including CCL2, in severe COVID-19 patients. 28 Our previous results also demonstrated that C5a mediated the infiltration of monocytes into the pleural cavity by inducing the expression of chemokines (CCL2, CCL7 and CX3CL1) released by PMCs in TPE. 21 These studies indicated that C5a was a strong chemoattractant for monocytes.

2,How does PHC facility attendance relate to breastfeeding behavior?,"["" formula milk or other foods. Of the sample of infants who were 5-6 months old, 93.1% of infants were still receiving breastmilk, but only 28.6% were breastfed predominantly.The prevalence of depressive symptoms in this survey sample was 26.9%. There was not a significant association between breastfeeding behaviour and depressive symptom scores (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.27).This survey found that women who had not visited a PHC facility recently (in the past two months) were significantly less likely to breastfeed (Table 2) . Overall, 85% of mothers who had been to a PHC facility recently breastfed their baby currently, while 75% of those who had not been to the clinic breastfed their baby currently. A test of proportions confirms that the difference between these means was significant (p = 0.004). There was also a significant relationship between predominant breastfeeding and recent PHC facility attendance. Predominant breastfeeding was practiced by 17% of mothers who had been to the clinic recently and by 11% of those who had not been to the clinic recently (p = 0.016). Approximately, 18.3% of respondents reported going to bed hungry over the past 7 days. Of the respondents who went to bed hungry, 28.2% rarely went to bed hungry, 37.9% sometimes went to bed hungry, and 28.0% often went to bed hungry. Overall, 1 in 20 (5.9%) respondents who went to bed hungry did not want to provide information on how often they went to bed hungry or said they did not know.Children going to bed hungry (asked in the second wave of the survey) was not associated with a decreased prevalence of breastfeeding (captured in the same round of the survey). However, mothers who reported that they went to bed hungry in the past seven nights were significantly less likely to report breastfeeding in the previous day (OR = 0.66; p = 0.045). Table 3 shows that this result also holds in a multivariate framework, including covariates such as depressive symptoms, attendance of PHC facility, and whether the infant was older than 3 months. The multivariate logistic regression's odds ratios for the covariates (depressive symptoms and attendance of PHC facility) are aligned with the significance and the direction of association reported for the bivariate relationships. The findings on breastfeeding practice found in this survey resonate with previous findings in South Africa. Breastfeeding initiation rates in South Africa are high (ranging from 75 to 100%), but continued breastfeeding varies, and there is widespread early introduction of foods and liquids other than breastmilk/formula milk [14] . The South African Demographic and Health Survey 2016 reported that 32% of infants younger than six months were exclusively breastfed [11] .Although this study found no association between breastfeeding and depressive symptoms, depressive symptoms could influence a mother's breastfeeding self-efficacy [13] and may result in a shorter duration of breastfeeding or a greater likelihood of breastfeeding cessation [15, 16] . The bidirectional relationship between depressive symptoms and breastfeeding may be due to breastfeeding, leading to better mother-infant interaction, the release of oxytocin, and decline in cortisol levels, which may improve maternal mood and reduce feelings of stress [17] .This relationship between clinic visits and breastfeeding found in this study could be attributable to the role of primary health care facilities in supporting and encouraging mothers to breastfeed. Alternatively, it could reflect an endogenous (intraperson) relationship between caregiving and care-seeking behaviours, reflective of intergenerational transmission of attachment [18] . It is argued that attachment, one of many behavioural systems, reflects intergenerational caring practices. The documented replacement of mother-child caring by grandmother-child caring in the South African context [19] may affect the caregiving (breastfeeding) and care-seeking (PHC visits) behaviours of mothers. It is also possible that not breastfeeding and not visiting clinics are related to other factors not assessed in this study.More regular clinic attendance may allow for an increase in knowledge on breastfeeding, improved self-efficacy for breastfeeding, and emotional support to breastfeeding [20] . A meta-analysis found that breastfeeding education and support were associated with both breastfeeding initiation and continuation [21] . There are some indications that postnatal support may be slightly more effective than antenatal breastfeeding education [22] , but both may be required to impact breastfeeding continuation [23] . Ultimately, breastfeeding support in a combination of settings (health services, the workplace, the home family, and community), along with appropriate policy, is required for improved breastfeeding [24] .Household hunger levels in South Africa have been decreasing; the 2017 estimates reveal that one in five households are food insecure and experience hunger [4] . Hunger in pre-birth and post-birth women specifically has not been assessed nationally before in South Africa, so the findings of this study on hunger cannot be compared with pre-COVID estimates.The current study does""]",There is a significant relationship between PHC facility attendance and breastfeeding behavior.

3,What are the natural hosts of Influenza A viruses?,"['The Role of Animal Models In Influenza Vaccine Research\nInfluenza is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Orthomyxoviridae consist of four genera: influenza A, influenza B, influenza C and Thogoto viruses. The proteins of influenza A viruses are encoded by genes on eight RNA segments. Influenza A viruses are widely distributed in nature and can infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, including humans. Influenza A virus subtypes are classified on the basis of the antigenicity of their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [1, 2] into 16 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes, and all of these subtypes have been found to infect birds [2, 3] . Waterfowl and shorebirds are the natural reservoirs of AI viruses.In their natural hosts, most AI infections are not associated with clinical disease, and the viruses are generally thought to be in evolutionary stasis [4] . In humans, relatively few subtypes of influenza A viruses have caused sustained outbreaks of disease; viruses bearing H1, H2, and H3 HA genes and N1 and N2 NA genes have circulated in the human population during the twentieth century. H1N1 viruses appeared in 1918 and circulated until 1957, when they were replaced by H2N2 viruses. These, in turn, were replaced in 1968 by H3N2 viruses, which continue to circulate. In 1977, H1N1 viruses reappeared and have continued to co-circulate with the H3N2 viruses. Influenza A and B viruses continue to cause epidemics in humans each winter.In addition to the seasonal influenza epidemics, the potential also exists for an influenza pandemic at any time. A pandemic occurs when an influenza strain with a novel HA subtype (with or without a novel NA subtype) appears and spreads in a susceptible human population. In the twentieth century, influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968 , and most recently, in 2009, with the emergence of the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. The influenza pandemic of 1918 was associated with severe morbidity and significant mortality but the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 were milder [5] . To date, disease caused by the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus does not appear to be more severe than disease seen with epidemic influenza, but there is a significant difference in the age groups most affected, with the majority of cases of pandemic 2009 H1N1 infection and hospitalization occurring in children and young adults and the highest mortality occurring in adults aged 24-49 years.AI viruses in their natural reservoir in waterfowl and shorebirds are one source from which novel HA and NA subtypes are introduced into the human population. An influenza virus with a novel HA and/or NA can be introduced into the human population by direct spread from either wild birds or domestic poultry, as was seen when an H5N1 AI virus infected humans in 1997 [6] . Alternatively, avian and human influenza viruses can reassort, generating a virus that can efficiently spread in humans, as happened in the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemics [7] . The pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is derived from influenza viruses that were circulating in pigs rather than birds. This virus is a reassortant, bearing gene segments that were originally derived from avian, human and classical swine influenza viruses [8] .Influenza A viruses also infect and cause disease in a wide variety of mammalian species, including swine, horses, ferrets, mink, dogs, seals, and whales. The currently circulating highly pathogenic AI H5N1 viruses that emerged in Asia in 2003 can also infect and cause lethal infection in felids, including tigers, leopards and domestic cats [9, 10] .Although several animal species can be infected with influenza A viruses naturally and experimentally, an ideal animal model for studying infection and immunity to human influenza has not been identified. Several animal species are permissive to infection with influenza A and B viruses to varying degrees and some exhibit clinical signs of illness and pathological changes in the respiratory tract that are similar to those seen in human influenza. In this chapter, we discuss the main features of the animal models used for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, their advantages and disadvantages, and their contribution to research on vaccines against influenza in humans. We also discuss the role of animal models in the development of vaccines against pandemic influenza. Veterinary vaccines for swine, equine, avian and canine influenza can be evaluated in their natural hosts and are not discussed.Vaccines have been available for epidemic or ""seasonal"" influenza since the 1940s. Inactivated influenza virus vaccines are still largely the same as they were when first developed. They are still generally produced in embryonated']",Waterfowl and shorebirds are the natural reservoirs of AI viruses.,simple,True
4,What is the importance of component detection in power line inspection using UAV images?,"["" two main optimization criteria are the accuracy of the prediction and the time inferred to obtain the solution ever more tailored solutions building on CNNs are being developed recently. Architectures such as VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) and ResNet (He et al. 2015a) for image classification and Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) and SSD (Liu et al. 2016 ) for object detection have proven to provide good accuracy at resonable inference time.CV is utilized for infrastructure inspection in many application domains. The typical challenges addressed with CV in this area are cases where large amounts of physical objects are to be inspected and they are geographically remote and / or dispersed. Selected research articles are presented in the following and summarized in Table 1. A major application area is road surface inspection and maintenance. Roads in bad condition can ultimately result in more accidents and higher costs (Baladi et al. 2017; Gleave et al. 2014) . Thus, CV is utilized to automatically assess road surface condition and derive necessary maintenance actions. Over the last years this became possible without expensive, specialized hardware (compare, e.g., Quintana et al. 2016) . Chatterjee et al. (2018) show how machine learning-based CV can be used to detect road surface cracks and develop a ''vision-based DSS for crack detection''. They offer first insights into a nascent design theory for the application case of road crack detection on the basis of images.Not only roads, but also railways need to be inspected periodically to ensure safe transports. Wei et al. (2019) employ a Faster R-CNN to detect defects of railway track fasteners. Gibert et al. (2017) propose a CNN-based multitask learning approach that detects railway track fasteners and crossties and classifies the state of these components.Wind turbine blades are another physical object of interest for CV-based infrastructure inspection. Akhloufi and Benmesbah (2014) present a CV approach to identify ice accreation on wind turbine blades. Ice accreation can require a maintenance action since it can cause malfunction and premature wear and is a safety hazard for nearby people and infrastructure like roads and powerlines. Shihavuddin et al. (2019) show how faults like leading edge erosion can be detected with a Faster R-CNN on wind turbine blades.In this work, we are particularly interested in CV solutions for power line inspection relying on UAV images. From a component-based view, power line inspection can be divided into four major categories: towers or poles, insulators, conductors, and fittings (Liu et al. 2020) . Each of these categories contains several subcomponents (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) that typically vary in size, kind, and material according to the voltage level. For instance, some part of a distribution network with low voltage might have wooden poles, small standing insulators, and a single, relatively thin conductor. On the other hand, transmission networks usually have lattice steel towers, large suspending insulators, and thicker conductors. Several studies have been published that utilize various potential platforms (e.g., helicopter, satellite, and UAV) to collect different data types (e.g., optical images, laser scanner data, thermal images, and synthetic aperture radar images) and analyzed these (Matikainen et al. 2016) . The vision-based approach -with image data from the visible spectrum captured by UAVs and automatically analyzed through image processing capabilities -has gained the most attention and traction in the power line inspection research domain (Liu et al. 2020) . With a few exceptions, automated vision-based power line inspection based on UAV-captured images requires two inherently related tasks (Liu et al. 2020) : component detection and localization as well as fault diagnosis. The exceptions relate to objects such as bird nests, whose detection already represents a fault. Previous research applying image processing for the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs is numerous (Mirallès et al. 2014) . Liu et al. (2020) identify several characteristics and shortcomings of previous studies using UAV-captured images in their exhaustive literature review. Most studies in the field of vision-based inspection of power lines focus on the insulator and its faults (Liu et al. 2020 ) -mainly missing caps (e.g., Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019; Zhai et al. 2018 ) -while little attention has been paid to other components. The safety pin that prevents other components from loosening and falling is the smallest object in the power line and has, despite its importance, received little attention and has only been regarded in fault diagnosis but not in the detection step. Finally, both Liu et al. (2020) and Nguyen et al. (2018) conclude that the mediocre performance of task-specific approaches presented in the vast majority of studies has been superseded by DL approaches that have improved""]","Component detection is important in power line inspection using UAV images because it helps identify and locate different components of the power line, such as towers or poles, insulators, conductors, and fittings.",simple,True
5,What is the genotype of the NDV strain isolated from the vaccinated layer flock in Egypt?,"["" [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Studies with MAbs established with the apathogenic strain NDV-D26 (genotype 2.I.1.1) established three different epitopes sensitive for both HI and NI activity of MAbs and mapped these sites to different amino acids when escape variants were analyzed [34] . Likewise HI-positive MAb AVS-I, raised against the avirulent LaSota vaccine strain (genotype 2.II) [35] mapped to aa residue 570 that was close to but not part of the other described epitopes [36] . This indicates that NDV strains might express at least slightly different neutralizing epitope patterns. Information for such epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII is not available.In order to characterize antigenic sites of circulating NDV genotype 2.VII, we generated genotype-specific MAbs that are able to block biologically active sites of the HN protein, i.e. antibodies that are able to neutralize infectivity and/or block HA activity. For this approach biophysically enriched HN protein fraction of purified virus proved to be an efficient antigen and the applied Concanavalin A (ConA)-ELISA technique that binds antigen not directly on the plate but coupled by the lectin, provided a high throughput system suitable to detect antibodies to conformation sensitive sites. The resulting MAbs were used to recognize unique neutralizing epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII.NDV strain chicken/EGY/NR730/2016 (NR730; Gen-Bank Acc. no. MH899939) was isolated from an ND vaccinated layer flock in Egypt suffering from respiratory distress. The virus was characterized as velogenic having an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 1.8 and belonged to genotype 2.VII.1.1 (formerly 2.VIIb) [37] . Pigeon type paramyxovirus-1 (pigeon/Germany/ R75/1998), genotype 2.VI, was derived from the repository of the ND reference laboratory at the FLI (Acc. No. KJ736742) and NDV/clone 30, genotype 2.II, was derived from a commercial vaccine (MSD, New Jersey, USA). As a source of polyclonal reference antibodies, watery egg yolk preparation from eggs from specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens was used, immunized repeatedly with specified inactivated NDV antigens. A monospecific rabbit α-NDV-HN serum and α-NDV-F serum [38] were used for specific detection of NDV-HN protein by western blot (WB) analysis. Immunizations were carried out in accordance with the legally approved protocol (MV-LALLF-7221.3-2.5-010/10).Virus was propagated in embryonated SPF chicken eggs (ECE) as described [39] (VALO BioMedia GmbH, Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany). Amino-allantoic fluid (AAF) was harvested on day 3 post infection (dpi) and purified by sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation. Briefly, debris was cleared from AAF by low speed centrifugation (30 min at 10,976 × g; 10,000 rpm Rotor JA-10; Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). Then virus was spun down by ultra-centrifugation (1.5 h at 96,281 × g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor, Beckman Coulter). Virus pellets from 6 tubes were re-suspended in a total of 45 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 1 M KCl (KCl-PBS) before adding 15 mL of the virus suspension on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30-60%, in KCl-PBS). Visible bands forming after ultra-centrifugation overnight (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter) were collected and diluted 1:5 in KCl-PBS before pelleting the virus by ultra-centrifugation for 1.5 h (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter). The final virus pellets, representing a total of 228 mL AAF were collected and resuspended in 1.5 ml KCl-PBS.

6,What were the results of the control animals infected with a recombinant human H1N1 influenza virus in the study?,"[' a Phase I clinical trial in humans [170] . Despite being highly restricted in replication, the vaccine virus was immunogenic in all subjects in at least one assay (HAI or neutralization assay). Again, the degree of restriction of replication of the vaccine virus in humans was not predicted by studies in mice.The emergence of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus prompted a rapid response from the research community and vaccine manufacturers to develop a vaccine against the emerging virus. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, based on the A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, were produced using the same manufacturing process and regulatory infrastructure as for seasonal influenza vaccines in order to make vaccine available expeditiously. The pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccines were evaluated in limited clinical trials to support licensure but extensive pre-clinical testing in animals was not performed. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines for the novel H1N1 influenza virus were licensed in September 2009 in the US. Animal models, however, will be needed for the continued study of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus and for the evaluation of alternative approaches to develop vaccines against this pathogen. Several laboratories have reported studies of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus isolates in laboratory animals. These studies are summarized in the following section.Pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses isolated from humans replicated efficiently in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice without prior adaptation [171, 172] . However, differences in the severity of disease caused by the A/California/04/ 2009 (H1N1) isolate were reported by the two laboratories. Maines et al. reported that the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) isolate was highly infectious in the mouse model, with a 50% mouse infectious dose (MID 50 ) of between 10 0.5 and 10 1.5 plaque forming units (PFU), but this virus and two other isolates (A/Texas/15/2009 and A/Mexico/4108/2009) were not lethal in mice; whereas Itoh and co-workers reported that the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus was lethal in mice at an LD 50 of 10 5.8 PFU, and that mortality was also observed in mice infected with another isolate, WSLH34939 (LD 50 of 10 4.5 PFU). In both studies, weight loss was observed in mice following infection with A/California/04/2009, but the disease was far more severe in the study conducted by Itoh et al. In both studies, the peak virus titer in the lungs at day 3 post-infection was similar (between 10 5.8 and 10 7.8 PFU), and virus replication was restricted to the respiratory tract. Higher levels of virus replication and more severe pathological changes were observed in the lungs of mice infected with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus compared to those inoculated with a recent seasonal human H1N1 influenza virus. Prominent bronchitis and alveolitis, with positive staining for viral antigen were observed on day 3 p.i. in mice infected with A/California/04/2009, with signs of regeneration present by day 6 p.i. [171] . Mice that were inoculated with the seasonal H1N1 virus had progressed to bronchitis and peribronchitis by day 6 p.i., but there was much less extensive staining for virus antigen in the tissues from these animals.An inactivated split-virion vaccine for pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza, administered with or without adjuvant (MF59), was evaluated in mice [173] . These studies suggested that a single dose of vaccine required an adjuvant to elicit a serum HAI response that was predictive of protection. Interim data from human clinical studies demonstrated that a single dose of 7.5 mg of HA, administered with MF59, did indeed elicit serum antibody responses that were predictive of protection, according to the criteria for the licensure of seasonal influenza vaccines [174] . However, data from recipients of the same vaccine administered without adjuvant were not reported [174] . Interim data from clinical trials of an inactivated pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine suggest that, surprisingly, a single dose of unadjuvanted vaccine is sufficiently immunogenic to meet the criteria established for the licensure of seasonal influenza vaccines [175] . The preliminary data from clinical trials of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine show evidence of immunologic priming to the novel H1N1 virus. The complex previous immunologic experience of humans with influenza viruses, either by prior infection or vaccination, cannot be emulated easily in experimental animals.The replication and virulence of pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses, compared to recent seasonal H1N1 human influenza viruses, were evaluated in ferrets [171, 172, 176] .']",nan,simple,True

In addition, NCD care should be integrated into existing HIV or TB programmes, as these are also addressing chronic conditions. Lessons learnt from these programmes should be used for NCD care including a differentiated service delivery approach. In addition, community engagement can help to empower patients in self-management of their condition and facilitate promotion of healthy lifestyles.The following elements are pillars of the response: coordination and partnership; human resources; supplies; health information system; monitoring and evaluation; and exit strategy/handover. They are equally important and mutually supporting, but need to be adapted during complex emergencies (emergencies where multiple concurrent factors lead to disruption of services [27] ), given the context-specific constraints, management challenges, and, at times, the high mobility of affected populations. Ethical considerations such as equity in care, screening or not for NCDs, public health versus individual health approach and data protection need to be addressed from the onset of an NCD programme in addition to advocacy and resource mobilization (Fig. 2 ).The response to NCDs includes identification of the intervention gaps in NCD management, the most urgent needs and the available and functioning resources (human, financial, infrastructure, etc.) in the given context. It should be in congruence with the national health system and integrated into existing services when possible. This approach will encourage ownership and facilitate the future handover of activities to local health services. Similarly, partnership with other international actors and with local non-governmental organizations involved in NCD care should be ensured. During the needs assessment, defined as the systematic evaluation of needs Table 2 Prioritization of care of a population and responses required [28] , it will be important to assess the presence of these local actors and resources that remain functional following the crisis. Not all stakeholders will provide the whole range of interventions and health services. The efficient use of available resources and expertise to equitably address the needs and gaps in the NCD response should be discussed.In addition, other local resources, such as HIV and TB programs, community groups, Women's groups, Elders and Diabetes associations, National Red Cross and Crescent Societies working in and for communities through a support network are key partners with whom to define priorities, to assist with the management of NCDs during the crisis and to provide continuity of support post-crisis [29] [30] [31] . These organizations might have existing resources such as patient education programs or support networks.Staff required for the management of NCDs include nurses, general medical practitioners, health promotion staff, and community health workers. The complex nature of many NCDs can lead to longer consultation time requirements than those for acute illnesses, which should be factored in when determining the number of staff required. If local human resources lack experience or expertise in NCD management, they may need to be supported by externally-sourced expert staff, and the treating medical team will need access to specialist support for challenging cases, either through patient referral or remote support to the clinicians. Standardised training material and context-appropriate guidelines should be made available to enhance staff knowledge and skills for NCD management. Regular supportive supervision and evaluation of staff performance should be set up.In HIV programs, resource allocation has been optimized through task-shifting and sharing, such as using nurses to follow-up stable patients [29] . This approach is increasingly being used in NCD care and should be routinely considered in humanitarian contexts [32] . For example, in many MSF programs doctors manage treatment initiation, and nurses provide routine treatment continuation for stable patients [33] [34] [35] . Patient education can also be shared among different team members, and health promotion staff (e.g. community health workers/volunteers/peers) can be used for group education.Care for people with NCDs requires reliable, affordable and regular access to medical supplies (i.e. essential medicines, laboratory tests, and medical devices such as glucose meters) to avoid treatment interruption or inappropriate management. A strategic plan for provision of supplies should be established in the initial step of the response and should include the following elements:A list of medical supplies based on the agencyprioritized interventions, the WHO model list of medicines, the Package of Essential Noncommunicable Diseases (PEN) list for devices and the national essential drug list.A system for procurement and storage of supplies. Cold chain capacity. This aspect can be coordinated with other agencies providing services requiring cold chain such as immunization.

8,How does the geographical information system view in the UIC support maintenance engineers in finding and inspecting adjacent infrastructure items and faults?,"["" and diagnose PLCs was introduced. Exemplary images (cf. Fig. 3, page 21) were shown to clarify the use case. The interviewees were allowed to ask questions of comprehension. Subsequently, in a semi-structured interview fashion each participant was asked to evaluate the DFs. A detailed overview of the questionnaire can be found in Appendix A3 on page 40. The question of whether each presented DF appropriately addresses its respective DPs served as the starting point. The interviewees opinion and attitude regarding all DFs was explored and probing questions were asked if necessary. This allowed us to assess the attitude of human expert workers towards the technology. This initial evaluation of part of the IB-DSS's tentative design serve as initial mediation to ensure that the final artifact can be designed as a useful and efficient instrument for solving our research question.In accordance with Hevner and Chatterjee 's (2010) suggestion for the analysis of confirmatory focus groups and King 's (1998) general proposal of template analysis for textual data, we adapted the approach for the analysis of the interview transcripts. The artifact's DPs served as the initial coding categories.In general, the interviewees confirmed the usefulness of the way the image acquisition (DP1) is performed and also acknowledged the image processing (DP2) to extract comparable, trustful, and helpful information. They specifically confirmed the usefulness of the vision-based approach for capturing a wide variety of different faults. More significantly, the ability to ''[...] look into the detailed pictures is already of high value'' (Iota) since it is easier to scope maintenance operations from component images rather than plain table entries. Additionally, the interviewees emphasized the good quality of the images as well as the improved perspective to view the PLCs and respective defects, due to the UAVs being able to fly close to the component of interest. Similarly, the functionality to automatically analyze the images for components and their faults was perceived as a major gain and precisely addressed the request of interviewee Zeta: ''It would actually be quite interesting if someone or something evaluates these pictures that the drone captures and then just sends the damage.'' The interviewees stressed several particular factors. First and foremost, the prevention of subjectivity was mentioned, leading to a uniformity in fault diagnosis and consequently to a flawless comparability between faults. Second, besides the presented ability to detect insulators, fittings, birdnests and safetypins, the interviewees assumed that several other components could be added easily. However, in more detail two participants raised doubts about the system's ability to recognize severe incidents such as completely broken and consequently dangling insulators. Finally, six out of the nine participants indicated, without being asked, that they felt there were benefits in using an automated process to extract defective components. They specifically mentioned benefits regarding timeliness, cost, and performance in comparison to the current manual inspection methods. However, although the proposed extraction of faults generated generally positive feedback, the need to ''comprehend: how did this assessment come about'' (Ny) was mentioned. Consequently, both the results and the reasoning of the fault diagnosis require visualization. Supporting MEs based on improved data and information quality requires making them accessible through a UIC. In the following, we describe the UICs' design and evaluation.To create a UIC that accomplishes the preliminary DRs of visualization (DR5) of the network and related defects (Shakhatreh et al. 2019) , we implemented the artifact based on the inferred DPs (cf. Fig. 2 on page 15) using Tableau 6 and Javascript. The artifact integrates two data sources: (1) UAV-captured image data (DP1) and its according metadata (DP3) as well as (2) metadata about the physical objects of the power line infrastructure (DP3) at our case company, such as geographical position or age. Information that is extracted as part of the image processing (cf. Sect. 5.2) is integrated into the artifact (DP2 and DP4). Finally, these building blocks are arranged in a meaningful way to support decision-making through visual data exploration (DP5). Figure 7 depicts the different views and their interactive links along with the respective DFs.To satisfy DP5, the general layout of the UIC should follow the visual exploration paradigm (Shneiderman 1996) and provide overview first, allow for zoom and filter capabilities, and then accommodate details on demand. We base our UIC on four different views which emphasize different task properties in our multidimensional data and maximize the availability of explicit and latent information. View (1) provides an operational dashboard view (DF7) to get a quick and aggregated sense of the condition of the power line infrastructure. View (2) contains a geographical information system view (DF5) to find and inspect adjacent infrastructure items and faults. This allows MEs to explore both the incident location to determine maintenance order specifics as well as further incidents which can be bundled""]",The geographical information system view in the UIC supports maintenance engineers in finding and inspecting adjacent infrastructure items and faults by allowing them to explore both the incident location to determine maintenance order specifics as well as further incidents which can be bundled.,simple,True
9,What is the significance of the MolProbity Ramachandran map in studying protein conformation?,"[' . 50,000 snapshots taken at 20 ps interval was available. We calculated the (φ,ψ) values at every snapshot for all the residues and classified them using MolProbity as previously described. Fig. 3(a) shows the percent of snapshots at which the residues were having outlier (φ,ψ) values. We see that for 222 out of 253 residues the percent of outlier conformations was non-zero, indicating that protein could adopt varying (φ,ψ) conformations during its motions. Also, in all the 222 residues, (φ,ψ) move from acceptable regions, which are of low energy to outlier regions, which are of apparent high energy. Fig. 3(b) shows the distribution of (φ,ψ) values of Lys 83 in the PKA MD trajectory on the MolProbity Ramachandran map. Apart from certain (φ,ψ) values falling in outlier regions of the map, we also see a huge variation in the (φ,ψ) values being accessed by the residue; there are a large number of observations with φ < 0 as well as φ > 0 , which are separated by inaccessible (φ,ψ) region. Prior studies on ultra-high-resolution peptide and protein structures have shown that the (φ,ψ) steric space is dramatically altered by subtle variations in backbone bond lengths and angles (Ravikumar et al., 2019) . Such changes in bond geometry could occur due to small-scale vibrational motions in the protein, which could make outlier (φ,ψ) conformations accessible to the residue. In other words, by modulating the bond lengths and angles within acceptable limits, the protein could lower the overall energy of an outlier (φ,ψ) conformation, thereby making it accessible. The MD trajectory of the mouse PKA could not be utilized to test this hypothesis since it was performed at 2 fs timestep, whereas studying bond vibrations requires simulations performed at 1 fs timescale or lower. Hence we performed MD simulations on five ultra-high-resolution (<0.8 Å) protein crystal structures at 1 fs timestep with constraints on bond lengths and angles removed so that changes in bond lengths and angles could be sampled (see Materials and Methods for details on the five proteins and the MD protocols used). From these MD trajectories we generated the bond geometry-specific (φ,ψ) steric maps for every residue in every snapshot of the simulation (as shown in Fig. 1 ).Before generating the bond geometry-specific steric maps from the MD trajectory, we first studied the distribution of backbone bond lengths and angles of all residues during the unconstrained 1-fs timestep simulation (see Methods for the list of bond parameters measured). We compared the mean, minimum and maximum values observed during MD to the standard, ideal values obtained from small-molecule peptide structures (Engh and Huber, 2012) . The maximum and minimum of the ideal geometry were defined as values which are þ5σ and -5σ away from the mean. All the distributions for the MD trajectory of Hen egg-white lysozyme (PDB code: 2VB1) are shown in Fig. 4 . The bond length and angle distributions for the remaining four proteins are shown in Supplementary Figs. 1-4. In almost all the bond parameters, the mean value observed from dynamics is very close to the mean values from static structures. Also, there are very few cases where the bond parameter values go beyond the maximum or minimum of ideal geometry range. It is to be noted that, despite the bond parameter distributions being obtained from dynamics simulations with no constraints on the bond lengths and angles, they are highly consistent with Engh & Huber values, which are obtained purely from static small molecule structures (Engh and Huber, 2012) . This validates the stereochemical accuracy of the unconstrained MD simulations. In order to ensure the robustness of these observations against the influence of force field used, we also simulated the lysozyme structure using OPLS-all-atom force field using the same MD protocol (Robertson et al., 2015) . The bond geometry distribution is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 . Here too we see for most of the parameters, the mean values from the simulation is very close to ideal values despite the removal of constraints.In the previous section, we have shown that there are variations in backbone bond parameters within acceptable limits of ideal peptide geometry during the simulation. Prior studies have also shown that such changes affect the extent of steric clash-free regions in (φ,ψ) steric map for a given residue (Ravikumar et al., 2019) . These steric clash-free regions depict the accessible (φ,ψ) space for the residue. Here, we wanted to see the effect of such subtle changes in']","The MolProbity Ramachandran map is significant in studying protein conformation because it shows the distribution of (φ,ψ) values of a residue, indicating the accessible and outlier regions in the (φ,ψ) space.",simple,True

Most death in COVID-19 patients were attributed to ARDS (93.3%, p = 0.039). Regression analysis revealed that obesity (OR = 6.31, 95% CI = 1.81-22.1, p = 0.004), active smoking (OR = 6.15, 95% CI = 2.15-17.6, p = 0.001), CURB-65 score (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.50-5.07, p = 0.001) and qSOFA score (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.15-5.6, p = 0.021) were associated with an increased risk of mortality ( Figure 2 ).Characteristics of 57 cancer (30 men and 27 women) and 203 noncancer patients were compared.

As of 5 September 2020, the total number of US COVID-19 infections had reached 6,095,007, with 185,687 deaths [15] . As the number of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections continues to rise, it has become increasingly important to characterize the disease process in varying patient populations for risk stratification. One highly vulnerable group is cancer patients, who tend to be hospitalized for a prolonged period, increasing their risk of exposure to COVID-19 [16] . They have a weakened immune system due to the cancer itself and treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy that they are undergoing. The current study included 260 COVID-19 patients in whom 57 cancer patients were compared with 203 noncancer patients, with breast and prostate cancer cases being the most frequent. Our findings indicate that cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 do not have significantly different outcomes in terms of adverse events or mortality rates than noncancer patients infected with COVID-19. Discharged cancer patients, however, did have higher rates of comorbidities, increased frequency of reintubation and prolonged length of hospital stay compared with noncancer COVID-19 patients. In this study, cancer cohorts were older and more likely to have comorbid conditions. Similarly, different studies consistently reported that patients with a variety of comorbidities -including hypertension, diabetes and obesity -are at a higher risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 than people without these conditions [17] .

Information about the severity of anemia, electrolyte imbalance, and CKD-mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD) were also collected.A structured questionnaire consisted of questions covering mental health status, concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures taken against COVID-19, and the psychological impact of COVID-19.Mental health status was assessed by the degree of symptoms related to depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. We adopted the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [15] , the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD-7) scale [16] , the 7-item Insomnia severity Index [17] , and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised(IES-R) [18] to measure the severity of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively Questionnaires measuring scales were provided by a hard copy.

12,Why are large quantities of data required for the DL vision-based MC?,"["" et al. 2015) . Accordingly, we present the image data collection, their subsequent processing and analysis through the MC, and the presentation of the results through the UIC along with their respective DFs depicted in Fig. 2 (cf. page 15) in the following three subsections.The platform responsible for the image data collection is required to capture images of sufficient quality. Consequently, it needs to be able to acquire uniform, standardized, and consistent image data in a potentially automated way (DP1). UAVs equipped with capabilities to capture optical images (DF1) meet these expectations (Nguyen et al. 2018; Matikainen et al. 2016; Spencer et al. 2019 ) for our specific use case. This is due to three main reasons. First, UAVs are able to capture images from above, below, and the front, combining the best aspects of today's helicopter, ground, and climbing inspection methods. Second, a UAV's ability to fly close to power lines allows it to take detailed images. Finally, although an approach for UAVs' autonomous navigation and image acquisition along power lines still has to be developed, the general feasibility of this automation step is undisputed (Nguyen et al. 2018) .To build an efficient IB-DSS for infrastructure maintenance, images containing relevant components, meaning components that exhibit faults, need to be identified from the entire dataset. For this purpose, we present the preparation, instantiation, and evaluation of our MC below.To build a DL vision-based MC, large quantities of data are required. We therefore collected images of PLCs, annotated them according to our desired component classes, prepared them for training through creation of several datasets, and finally used them for model training. The images were collected by flying a UAV along highvoltage power lines in several selected areas in southern Germany and circling around power towers to take pictures of PLCs. The power line passages were selected so that the captured images would contain diverse background scenes and PLCs of varying age and type. For each power tower, around 70 images were captured. Images containing faulty safety pins were created artificially in collaboration with field experts. Accordingly, an insulator and fitting application was installed in the lower area of one power tower (see Fig. 3 -left image) and a sequence of 608 images was captured while modifying the splint itself as well as changing the respective image perspective.After collecting the images, each one was annotated with bounding boxes (BB GT ) representing the ground truth. Each BB was associated with one of five PLC classes (insulator, fitting top ; fitting bottom ; birdnest, safetypin) that we chose for this project. These annotations and the respective images eventually constituted our root dataset DS Ro , containing 1424 insulators, 1073 fittings top , 1438 fittings bottom , 61 birdnests, and 5186 safetypins. Two further datasets DS1 Co and DS2 Fi were obtained through subsampling DS Ro to train different aspects of the object detection as depicted in Table 5 . Finally, DS3 Pi was derived to train the classifier for safetypins, with 1494 images of defective and 3692 images of intact safetypins. The characteristics of the four datasets are summarized in Table 5 and sample images are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 (cf. page 21).Inspired by Nguyen et al. (2019) and Liu et al. (2020) , we designed a DL-based multistage component detection (MSCD) and classification pipeline for high-resolution images containing multisized objects with spatial relationships (DF2 and DF3) to satisfy DP2. This addresses the requirement for automation (DR3) of infrastructure inspection (Katrasnik et al. 2010; Montambault et al. 2010 and reproducability (DR4) of the derived results to mitigate subjective decisions (Katrasnik et al. 2010; Toth and Gilpin-Jackson 2010) . While our case company is interested in the fault diagnosis of a significantly larger number of components, for the purpose of this study we intend to only demonstrate the feasibility of detecting both the smallest components (safetypins), as well as the largest ones (insulators), in images taken of high-voltage power lines -a topic not yet considered in the automated inspection of power lines. The pipeline consists of three elements responsible for different detection and classification tasks, as displayed in Fig. 5 .In the proposed MSCD pipeline, the (large) component detector first detects insulator, fitting top ; fitting bottom ; For the implementation of the MSCD, we chose to compare two well-proven DL object detection architectures -SSD (Liu et al. 2016) and Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015 ) -which we additionally benchmarked against a single-stage component detection pipeline (SSCD), meaning all components are detected in one step.

13,What is the potential use of JAKi drugs like baricitinib in the treatment of severe COVID-19?,"["" [99] [100] [101] [102] That ruxolitinib is able to be effective in cases of GVHd resistant to corticotherapy clearly indicates its immunosuppressive effects are not identical to those of corticotherapy. 97 98 The mechanisms assessed in mouse models of GVHd involve JAKi-mediated suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of the proliferation of effector T cells, with ruxolitinib impairing differentiation of CD4 + T cells into IFNγ-and IL17A-producing cells. 103 Experience with JAKi in CoVId-19 Significant clinical experience has been accumulated on the use of JAKi for treating COVID-19 and associated inflammatory status (table 1) .The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with inflammatory or autoimmune rheumatic diseases remains unclear and, as immune-compromised patients, people with systemic rheumatic diseases are at increased risk of infection, including by SARS-CoV-2. 104 This is due to their underlying immune conditions and to immunemodulating therapies such as biologics. Whether background immunosuppressive medications put individuals with rheumatic disease at an increased or decreased risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown, and evidence is lacking to guide treatment decisions. 105 This population may, however, represent an interesting group to study as some disease-modifying drugs commonly used to treat rheumatic diseases, such as hydroxychloroquine, or biologics targeting interleukin IL-6 (as tocilizumab) 51 52 106 107 or sarilumab, 108 IL-1 (as anakinra) 56 or JAKi are being or have been assessed in patients with severe COVID-19.It should be added that in times of broad vaccination against COVID-19 in Western countries, one study demonstrated that the overall response rate to COVID-19 vaccine in patients suffering from systemic rheumatic diseases treated with JAKi remained high, 109 in line with rates reported with other immunosuppressants. 110 In this review, we will develop on the use of JAKi for the treatment of severe form of COVID-19.Baricitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, was suggested as soon as February 2020 as a potential treatment for COVID-19 acute respiratory disease 111 using BenevolentAI's knowledge graph. BenevolentAI is a large repository of structured medical information that include different and numerous connections extracted by machine learning. Adaptation/customization to COVID-19 was applied to this resource and approved drugs that may inhibit the viral infection were searched. Baricitinib was identified as a potential molecule that could inhibit infection of lung cells by SARS-CoV-2. One of the key cell subtypes expressing the ACE2 receptor are lung AT2 alveolar cells. Viruses enter by endocytosis and many small molecule kinase inhibitors were shown to prevent entry into cells of different virus types. 112 113 One regulator of endocytosis is AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), which belongs to the group of Numb-Associated Kinases. A prediction was formulated that inhibition of AAK1 could prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry and then also intracellular virion assembly. One of the molecules predicted to inhibit AAK1 was baricitinib which also binds to another endocytosis regulator, cyclin G-associated kinase. The prediction was that baricitinib would inhibit both virus entry (via AAK1 targeting) and inflammation by targeting JAK1 and JAK2 downstream many cytokine receptors during cytokine storm. 111 This work was extended and the affinity and selectivity of the identified drugs were examined in order to point to anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs. Baricitinib, fedratinib and ruxolitinib were highlighted as having similar JAK-STAT inhibitory potency, baricitinib stood out due to its AAK1 inhibition capacity. In a EMEA trial with baricitinib for autoimmune diseases in 4214 patients, a small increase in upper respiratory infection has been seen, but the incidence of severe infections was similar to placebo. 114 That baricitinib holds the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection was also reviewed in reference 115.

14,What effects does C5a have on A549 cells?,"[' et al. reported that blockade of the C5a-C5aR1 axis resulted in a substantial improvement in the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies against lung cancer growth and metastasis through CXCL16-mediated effects. 29 We demonstrated high expression of CCL2 but no difference in CCL7 or CX3CL1 expression in MPE compared with transudate plural effusion (Figure 3 Compared with other monocyte subsets, intermediate monocytes in humans express higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, 30, 31 which promotes the progression of tumors. 32 However, the role of cytokines released by intermediate monocytes in MPE needs to be further elucidated. Our data showed a significant increase in IL-1β expression in MPE supernatant and a higher level of IL-1β secretion in intermediate monocytes isolated from MPE (Figure 4(a),(b) ). Consistent with a previous in vitro study in neutrophils, 33 our data showed that C5a has the potential to induce the generation of LPS-stimulated IL-1β in intermediate monocytes (Figure 4(c) , (d)). Collectively, our results demonstrated that the C5a-C5aR axis not only regulates the infiltration of intermediate monocytes into the pleural cavity, but also increases the proportion of IL-1β-releasing intermediate monocytes, which participate in the immune response in MPE.Although C5a has been reported to be an essential mediator of inflammation-induced tumorigenesis, little information is known about its role in the progression of tumor cells. 17 We found that C5a induced A549 cell proliferation in lung cancer, which was consistent with the findings of Chen et al. 20 Chen et al. also proved that the C5a-C5aR pathway participates in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer via activation of the PI3K/AKT axis. 19 Similarly, our results showed that C5a treatment led to a highly significant increase in the levels of p-AKT. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor LY29f4002 was reported to inhibit A549 proliferation in the presence of C5a ( Figure 5(d) ,(e)). Thus, it is plausible to suggest that C5a-C5aR signaling regulates the proliferation of lung carcinoma cells via PI3K/AKT axis activation. Some reports have indicated that the C5a-C5aR axis decreases apoptosis in several cell types, such as neutrophils, 34 T cells, 35 and macrophages. 36 Our current study suggested that the C5a-C5aR axis could protect lung cancer cells from DDP-induced apoptosis ( Figure 5 (h),(i)). The migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of tumor cells are also important factors influencing tumor metastasis. Our data revealed that C5a facilitated the migration and invasion of lung carcinoma cells ( Figure 5 (j),(k)). Additionally, C5a was reported to promote the intercellular adhesion of A549 cells to PMCs ( Figure 5 (l),(m)), consistent with previous studies, which proved that C5a was the principal initiator of neutrophil adhesion by regulating cell adhesion molecules. 37 Furthermore, the C5a axis showed a similar role in promoting EMT in A549 cells ( Figure 5 (n)) as it did in renal tubular epithelial cells. 38 Overall, our study revealed that C5a exerted a tumor-promoting effect by inducing the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of A549 cells and inhibiting the apoptosis of tumor cells, while C5aRA significantly reversed these effects.IL-1β has emerged as a key component of tumorpromoting inflammation by shaping different elements of the tumor microenvironment, including cancer cell proliferation, 32,39 migration, and metastasis. 32, 40 Based on our data showing that C5a has the ability to induce IL-1β secretion from intermediate monocytes, we attempted to explore the role of IL-1β overexpression stimulated by C5a. Here, we demonstrated that the IL-1β/IL-1R axis could promote the proliferation of A549 cells in vitro (Figure 6(a) , (b)), which was consistent with previous studies on human natural killer cells and glioblastoma cells. 41 We also found a tendency towards the upregulation of MAPK/p-MAPK expression in A549 cells after IL-1β treatment (Figure 6(c) ), but further study is needed to confirm whether the MAPK signaling pathway is the main mechanism by which IL-1β induces the growth of tumor cells. According to previous studies, the IL-1β/IL-1R axis is also a regulator of apoptosis in several cell types. 42 Our study reached a similar', ' stimulation, the IL-1β expression in the presence of LPS in intermediate monocytes were increased elevated, while C5aRA could prevent this stimulation (Figure 4(c) ). As shown in Figure 4 (d), ELISA detection of monocyte culture supernatant showed a similar result. Our findings indicated that C5a enhanced IL-1β release from CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes in MPE C5a plays a role in the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of lung cancer cellsTo investigate the role of C5a in the progression of MPE, we first evaluated the effects of C5a on the proliferation of A549 cells. As indicated by Ki-67 expression levels and the CCK-8 assay, C5a subsantially promoted A549 cell proliferation, while C5aRA suppressed it ( Figure 5(a),(b) ). By western blot, we further found that C5a caused a significant increase in the levels of p-AKT and PI3K expression, and this effect could be inhibited by C5aRA (Figure 5(c) ). The PI3K inhibitor LY29f4002 resulted in a decrease in Ki-67-positive A549 cells and a lower proliferation index than C5a treatment alone ( Figure 5(d) ,(e)).As flow cytometry and Western blot results indicated, neither C5a nor C5aRA exerted a significant effect on the Figure 5 (h),(i), the apoptosis of A549 cells and the protein levels of cleaved-Caspase 3 and Bax were significantly decreased in the C5a + DDP group, while they were elevated in the C5aRA + DDP group, and C5a could reverse the increase in apoptosis caused by C5aRA.We then sought to investigate whether C5a was involved in the regulation of tumor cell migration and invasion. As soon as 24 h after wounding, C5a showed promoting effects on A549 wound closure ( Figure 5(j) ). Unexpectedly, incubation with C5aRA alone had no effects on A549 migration, while it was harmful to C5a-enhanced A549 cell wound healing ( Figure 5(j) ). As expected, the addition of C5a strongly promoted tumor invasion activity. Although the addition of C5aRA alone did not affect this invasion activity, it significantly suppressed the invasion activity increased by C5a (Figure 5(k) ).The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) was significantly elevated after C5a treatment, which could be abolished by the addition of C5aRA ( Figure 5(l) ). An adhesion assay further confirmed that a significant number of A549 cells adhered to the PMC monolayer within 24 h. As expected, C5a strongly enhanced adhesion, while C5aRA abrogated the enhanced adhesion activity of tumor cells and PMCs ( Figure 5(m) ). Moreover, Western blot results demonstrated that the levels of N-cadherin and vimentin, markers of mesenchymal cells, were significantly increased in C5a-treated A549 cells, whereas the expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial cell marker, was severely decreased. Our results also indicated that C5aRA had the opposite effect on EMT in A549 cells as C5a (Figure 5(n) ).As shown in Figure 6(a),(b) , Ki-67 expression and the proliferation index of A549 cells were increased in the presence of IL-1β, and this effect was dramatically inhibited by the IL-1R antagonist (IL-1RA). The MAPK pathway is the bestknown signaling pathway in the development of cancer and regulates important cellular processes such as proliferation. We then assessed the protein levels of MAPK and p-MAPK in treated A549 cells and found that IL-1β treatment resulted in a significant increase in the levels of MAPK and (Figure 6(c) ). Our data showed that apoptosis was significantly lower in IL-1β-treated cells than in untreated control cells, while the IL-1β receptor antagonist significantly stimulated the apoptosis of A549 cells (Figure 6(d) ,(e)).As the wound-healing assay showed, there was a significant decline in A549 migration in the IL-1RA group compared to the control group after 36 h (Figure 6(f) ). As the transwell assay showed, in the presence of IL-1β, tumor invasion activity was promoted, while the addition of IL-1RA significantly prevented the increase in invasion capability caused by IL-1β (Figure 6(g) ).In addition, IL-1β significantly induced ICAM-1 expression in lung cancer cells, and this effect was abolished by the addition of IL-1']","C5a has multiple effects on A549 cells including promoting proliferation, increasing levels of p-AKT and PI3K expression, inhibiting apoptosis, enhancing migration and invasion, increasing adhesion to PMC monolayer, and inducing EMT.",simple,True

16,"What is the relationship between IL-1β, N-cadherin expression, and intermediate monocyte recruitment in MPE?","['RA (Figure 6(h) ). As shown in Figure 6 (i), IL-1β strongly enhanced the adhesion of A549 cells to the PMC monolayer, while IL-1RA abrogated the adhesion capability. As indicated in the Western blot results in Figure 6 (j), IL-1β increased the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, whereas it had no effect on E-cadherin. IL-1RA had the opposite effect on EMT markers compared with IL-1β.In previous studies, we reported that the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a could enhance the homing of nonclassical monocytes to the pleural cavity by the chemokine axis in The protein levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin were detected by Western blot (n = 3). *Versus. control group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. # Versus C5a group, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01. & Versus C5aRA group, & p < 0.05, && p < 0.01 tuberculosis pleural effusion (TPE). 21 In the present study, we extended our previous work and demonstrated that the activation of C5a in MPE induced the recruitment of intermediate monocytes and played an essential role in the progression of MPE.In the context of cancer, complement C3a and C5a, which leads to tumor-promoting chronic inflammation in the majority of the studied mouse models, are continually generated. 23 However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of the complement system, especially C3a and C5a, in MPE remain unknown. In the present study, we observed activation of the classical and alternative pathways, while little presence of the MBL pathway in malignant pleurisy tissue (Figure 2) , which is different from tuberculous pleurisy. 21 Li et al. elucidated an unknown feature of MBL function in suppressing tumor development. 24 Consistent with their results, we also detected no MBL expression in MPE, indicating that in advanced tumors, low or even no MBL expression is favorable to tumor development and promotes tumor growth. Considering the differential activation of the complement pathway in MPE and TPE, the expressions of complement factors in pleural effusion might be a promising diagnostic marker. In the present study, we detected high activation of C5a and low levels of C3a, both by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Our data were consistent with those reported by Bulla and colleagues, 15 which revealed a strong signal for C1q in lung adenocarcinoma and mild expression of C3. Thus, the activation of the classical and alternative pathways is increased in MPE and may be responsible for the high level of C5a. Because C5a is a strong chemoattractant for inflammatory cells, the major focus of this study was to explore the role of C5a and monocytes in MPE progression.Emerging evidence indicates that monocytes contribute to carcinogenesis by releasing inflammatory mediators. 25 Wang et al. reported that the CD163 + CD14 + and CD206 + CD14 + cell frequencies in MPE were markedly higher than those in benign pleural effusion, and these CD14 positive cells could potentially be used as an immune diagnostic marker for MPE. 26, 27 However, the authors did not analyze the subtype of monocytes in MPE. In agreement with Wang et al. our data also revealed that the portion of monocytes was higher in MPE, showing significant increases compared to those in the blood (Figure 1(a),(b) ). In addition, we demonstrated that CD14 ++ CD16 À classical monocytes were decreased in malignant pleurisy patients, while CD14 + CD16 + nonclassical and CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes were significantly increased in MPE, which was different from the observations in TPE. 21 Interestingly, the proportion of CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes in MPE was 12 times higher than that in peripheral blood (Figure 1(c) , (d)). However, it is unclear how these accumulating intermediate monocytes enter the pleural cavity and whether they promote the progression of MPE.Monocytes were found to be recruited by complement C5a through the increased secretion of chemokines, including CCL2, in severe COVID-19 patients. 28 Our previous results also demonstrated that C5a mediated the infiltration of monocytes into the pleural cavity by inducing the expression of chemokines (CCL2, CCL7 and CX3CL1) released by PMCs in TPE. 21 These studies indicated that C5a was a strong chemoattractant for monocytes.

17,"What distribution is assigned to the seroprevalences in the model, considering the experts' assumptions and beliefs?","[', and the logarithm of age as an offset. The only other term in the model is an intercept, which is the logarithm of the force of infection [13] . As a rate, the force of infection can take non-negative values, possibly greater than 1 [24] . A vague prior distribution-Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation 1,000-is specified for the logarithm of the force of infection. Example data from a single serosurvey of dengue are from Colombo, Sri Lanka, which used a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) [14, 25] . Here we omit individuals aged less than six months in order to limit the influence of maternal antibodies.For two repeated serosurveys, priors are placed on the seroprevalences, and the values of interest are related via standard identities. The baseline seroprevalence is assigned a beta distribution with both parameters equal to 1, i.e. uniform on the interval [0, 1]. The prior for the second seroprevalence is the same except that, consistent with the above assumptions, it is constrained to be at least as high as the baseline seroprevalence. For each survey, the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) are defined in terms of the seroprevalence and the assumed sensitivity and specificity [26] :The probability of each person being truly seropositive, Prob(D + ), is then PPV if the test is positive, and 1 − NPV if the test is negative. The probabilities of testing positive or negative are functions of sensitivity and specificity, in the same way as for a single survey. Finally, the numerator of the force of infection is estimated as the increase in expected number of true positives from the first to the second survey, and the denominator is estimated as the expected person-time at risk, calculated as the sum of the individual times between the surveys, weighted by each individual\'s probability of being seronegative at baseline. This is shown in the following equation, where the sum is over all individuals in both surveys, and the subscripts on D indicate the first or second survey:This is shown schematically, as a Directed Acyclic Graph [27] , in Fig 1. Example data are from a community-based study of dengue in Medellin, Colombia, using a commercially available IgG indirect ELISA test [25] (S5 File). Residents were randomly selected, and tested in up to five surveys over time. For the current purpose, we use only the first survey, done in 2011, and the last one, done in 2014, approximately 26 months later.In the standard binomial regression model for seroconversion across paired surveys, those individuals positive at baseline are assumed to be not at risk, i.e. there is no allowance for measurement error in the serostatus. By contrast, as well as seroconversion, the current model allows seroreversion, i.e. for individuals to change from seropositive to seronegative status.Fixed values for sensitivity and specificity can be used for the repeated surveys, as described above for a single one. However, there may be reasonable doubt as to the exact values of sensitivity and specificity, e.g. because of cross-reacting pathogens circulating to an unknown extent. This uncertainty may have been quantified by systematic reviews, although their generalizability to a given setting may be doubtful. Another way to quantify uncertainty is in terms of expert opinion, e.g. via the Delphi technique [28] . Here we follow the elicitation method of Johnson et al. [29] . For each parameter, each expert is presented with a range of values. For the current purpose, the parameters are sensitivity and specificity, each with a range of 0 to 100%, in intervals (""bins"") of 5%. Each expert is invited to i) make a point or ""average"" estimate of the parameter in question, then ii) indicate the upper and lower limit of their estimate, then iii) indicate their weight of belief by allocating a total of 100% over the bins, between the upper and lower limits, in units of 5%. So we have a total of six questions: three each for sensitivity and specificity. Johnson et al., used paper questionnaires and stickers for the units of 5% weight of belief. We adapted this to a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel (S1 File). This approach could also be applied to the analysis of a single survey.For the current study, beliefs were elicited from three dengue researchers whose published work includes results of diagnostic tests. Two of these (JKL & MC) were also investigators of the serological study in Medellin [25] .

18,"""What are the historical influenza pandemics and how do animal models help study prevention strategies?""","['The Role of Animal Models In Influenza Vaccine Research\nInfluenza is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Orthomyxoviridae consist of four genera: influenza A, influenza B, influenza C and Thogoto viruses. The proteins of influenza A viruses are encoded by genes on eight RNA segments. Influenza A viruses are widely distributed in nature and can infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, including humans. Influenza A virus subtypes are classified on the basis of the antigenicity of their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [1, 2] into 16 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes, and all of these subtypes have been found to infect birds [2, 3] . Waterfowl and shorebirds are the natural reservoirs of AI viruses.In their natural hosts, most AI infections are not associated with clinical disease, and the viruses are generally thought to be in evolutionary stasis [4] . In humans, relatively few subtypes of influenza A viruses have caused sustained outbreaks of disease; viruses bearing H1, H2, and H3 HA genes and N1 and N2 NA genes have circulated in the human population during the twentieth century. H1N1 viruses appeared in 1918 and circulated until 1957, when they were replaced by H2N2 viruses. These, in turn, were replaced in 1968 by H3N2 viruses, which continue to circulate. In 1977, H1N1 viruses reappeared and have continued to co-circulate with the H3N2 viruses. Influenza A and B viruses continue to cause epidemics in humans each winter.In addition to the seasonal influenza epidemics, the potential also exists for an influenza pandemic at any time. A pandemic occurs when an influenza strain with a novel HA subtype (with or without a novel NA subtype) appears and spreads in a susceptible human population. In the twentieth century, influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968 , and most recently, in 2009, with the emergence of the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. The influenza pandemic of 1918 was associated with severe morbidity and significant mortality but the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 were milder [5] . To date, disease caused by the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus does not appear to be more severe than disease seen with epidemic influenza, but there is a significant difference in the age groups most affected, with the majority of cases of pandemic 2009 H1N1 infection and hospitalization occurring in children and young adults and the highest mortality occurring in adults aged 24-49 years.AI viruses in their natural reservoir in waterfowl and shorebirds are one source from which novel HA and NA subtypes are introduced into the human population. An influenza virus with a novel HA and/or NA can be introduced into the human population by direct spread from either wild birds or domestic poultry, as was seen when an H5N1 AI virus infected humans in 1997 [6] . Alternatively, avian and human influenza viruses can reassort, generating a virus that can efficiently spread in humans, as happened in the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemics [7] . The pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is derived from influenza viruses that were circulating in pigs rather than birds. This virus is a reassortant, bearing gene segments that were originally derived from avian, human and classical swine influenza viruses [8] .Influenza A viruses also infect and cause disease in a wide variety of mammalian species, including swine, horses, ferrets, mink, dogs, seals, and whales. The currently circulating highly pathogenic AI H5N1 viruses that emerged in Asia in 2003 can also infect and cause lethal infection in felids, including tigers, leopards and domestic cats [9, 10] .Although several animal species can be infected with influenza A viruses naturally and experimentally, an ideal animal model for studying infection and immunity to human influenza has not been identified. Several animal species are permissive to infection with influenza A and B viruses to varying degrees and some exhibit clinical signs of illness and pathological changes in the respiratory tract that are similar to those seen in human influenza. In this chapter, we discuss the main features of the animal models used for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, their advantages and disadvantages, and their contribution to research on vaccines against influenza in humans. We also discuss the role of animal models in the development of vaccines against pandemic influenza. Veterinary vaccines for swine, equine, avian and canine influenza can be evaluated in their natural hosts and are not discussed.Vaccines have been available for epidemic or ""seasonal"" influenza since the 1940s. Inactivated influenza virus vaccines are still largely the same as they were when first developed. They are still generally produced in embryonated']","The historical influenza pandemics include the ones that occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009.

The typical challenges addressed with CV in this area are cases where large amounts of physical objects are to be inspected and they are geographically remote and / or dispersed. Selected research articles are presented in the following and summarized in Table 1. A major application area is road surface inspection and maintenance. Roads in bad condition can ultimately result in more accidents and higher costs (Baladi et al. 2017; Gleave et al. 2014) . Thus, CV is utilized to automatically assess road surface condition and derive necessary maintenance actions. Over the last years this became possible without expensive, specialized hardware (compare, e.g., Quintana et al. 2016) . Chatterjee et al. (2018) show how machine learning-based CV can be used to detect road surface cracks and develop a ''vision-based DSS for crack detection''. They offer first insights into a nascent design theory for the application case of road crack detection on the basis of images.Not only roads, but also railways need to be inspected periodically to ensure safe transports. Wei et al. (2019) employ a Faster R-CNN to detect defects of railway track fasteners. Gibert et al. (2017) propose a CNN-based multitask learning approach that detects railway track fasteners and crossties and classifies the state of these components.Wind turbine blades are another physical object of interest for CV-based infrastructure inspection. Akhloufi and Benmesbah (2014) present a CV approach to identify ice accreation on wind turbine blades. Ice accreation can require a maintenance action since it can cause malfunction and premature wear and is a safety hazard for nearby people and infrastructure like roads and powerlines. Shihavuddin et al. (2019) show how faults like leading edge erosion can be detected with a Faster R-CNN on wind turbine blades.In this work, we are particularly interested in CV solutions for power line inspection relying on UAV images. From a component-based view, power line inspection can be divided into four major categories: towers or poles, insulators, conductors, and fittings (Liu et al. 2020) . Each of these categories contains several subcomponents (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) that typically vary in size, kind, and material according to the voltage level. For instance, some part of a distribution network with low voltage might have wooden poles, small standing insulators, and a single, relatively thin conductor. On the other hand, transmission networks usually have lattice steel towers, large suspending insulators, and thicker conductors. Several studies have been published that utilize various potential platforms (e.g., helicopter, satellite, and UAV) to collect different data types (e.g., optical images, laser scanner data, thermal images, and synthetic aperture radar images) and analyzed these (Matikainen et al. 2016) . The vision-based approach -with image data from the visible spectrum captured by UAVs and automatically analyzed through image processing capabilities -has gained the most attention and traction in the power line inspection research domain (Liu et al. 2020) . With a few exceptions, automated vision-based power line inspection based on UAV-captured images requires two inherently related tasks (Liu et al. 2020) : component detection and localization as well as fault diagnosis. The exceptions relate to objects such as bird nests, whose detection already represents a fault. Previous research applying image processing for the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs is numerous (Mirallès et al. 2014) . Liu et al. (2020) identify several characteristics and shortcomings of previous studies using UAV-captured images in their exhaustive literature review. Most studies in the field of vision-based inspection of power lines focus on the insulator and its faults (Liu et al. 2020 ) -mainly missing caps (e.g., Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019; Zhai et al. 2018 ) -while little attention has been paid to other components. The safety pin that prevents other components from loosening and falling is the smallest object in the power line and has, despite its importance, received little attention and has only been regarded in fault diagnosis but not in the detection step. Finally, both Liu et al. (2020) and Nguyen et al. (2018) conclude that the mediocre performance of task-specific approaches presented in the vast majority of studies has been superseded by DL approaches that have improved""]","VGG16 and ResNet architectures work well for image classification, while Faster R-CNN and SSD architectures work well for object detection in power line inspection and maintenance.",multi_context,True

Studies with MAbs established with the apathogenic strain NDV-D26 (genotype 2.I.1.1) established three different epitopes sensitive for both HI and NI activity of MAbs and mapped these sites to different amino acids when escape variants were analyzed [34] . Likewise HI-positive MAb AVS-I, raised against the avirulent LaSota vaccine strain (genotype 2.II) [35] mapped to aa residue 570 that was close to but not part of the other described epitopes [36] . This indicates that NDV strains might express at least slightly different neutralizing epitope patterns. Information for such epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII is not available.In order to characterize antigenic sites of circulating NDV genotype 2.VII, we generated genotype-specific MAbs that are able to block biologically active sites of the HN protein, i.e. antibodies that are able to neutralize infectivity and/or block HA activity. For this approach biophysically enriched HN protein fraction of purified virus proved to be an efficient antigen and the applied Concanavalin A (ConA)-ELISA technique that binds antigen not directly on the plate but coupled by the lectin, provided a high throughput system suitable to detect antibodies to conformation sensitive sites. The resulting MAbs were used to recognize unique neutralizing epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII.NDV strain chicken/EGY/NR730/2016 (NR730; Gen-Bank Acc. no. MH899939) was isolated from an ND vaccinated layer flock in Egypt suffering from respiratory distress. The virus was characterized as velogenic having an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 1.8 and belonged to genotype 2.VII.1.1 (formerly 2.VIIb) [37] . Pigeon type paramyxovirus-1 (pigeon/Germany/ R75/1998), genotype 2.VI, was derived from the repository of the ND reference laboratory at the FLI (Acc. No. KJ736742) and NDV/clone 30, genotype 2.II, was derived from a commercial vaccine (MSD, New Jersey, USA). As a source of polyclonal reference antibodies, watery egg yolk preparation from eggs from specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens was used, immunized repeatedly with specified inactivated NDV antigens. A monospecific rabbit α-NDV-HN serum and α-NDV-F serum [38] were used for specific detection of NDV-HN protein by western blot (WB) analysis. Immunizations were carried out in accordance with the legally approved protocol (MV-LALLF-7221.3-2.5-010/10).Virus was propagated in embryonated SPF chicken eggs (ECE) as described [39] (VALO BioMedia GmbH, Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany). Amino-allantoic fluid (AAF) was harvested on day 3 post infection (dpi) and purified by sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation. Briefly, debris was cleared from AAF by low speed centrifugation (30 min at 10,976 × g; 10,000 rpm Rotor JA-10; Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). Then virus was spun down by ultra-centrifugation (1.5 h at 96,281 × g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor, Beckman Coulter). Virus pellets from 6 tubes were re-suspended in a total of 45 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 1 M KCl (KCl-PBS) before adding 15 mL of the virus suspension on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30-60%, in KCl-PBS). Visible bands forming after ultra-centrifugation overnight (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter) were collected and diluted 1:5 in KCl-PBS before pelleting the virus by ultra-centrifugation for 1.5 h (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter). The final virus pellets, representing a total of 228 mL AAF were collected and resuspended in 1.5 ml KCl-PBS.

21,"Why is estimating the force of infection important in public health, and how can it be accurately measured despite imperfections in serological surveys?","['Estimating force of infection from serologic surveys with imperfect tests\nThe force of infection, or the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected, is an important public health measure of the speed and extent of an epidemic. It can be used to quantify the impact of disease control programs, and prioritize and identify geographical regions requiring further measures, such as vaccine implementation [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . For infections inducing a lasting immune response, the force of infection is usually estimated via serological surveys (\'serosurveys\') of immunological status. Ideally, assays used in such surveys should be highly sensitive and specific, while also suitable for high throughput in terms of cost and personnel requirements [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In practice, however, available assays may not completely meet all these criteria, as is currently evident with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [12] . The greater the imperfections in sensitivity and specificity, the less accurate will be the corresponding estimates of the force of infection, as long as such imperfections are not taken into account.The force of infection may be estimated from single or repeated serosurveys. In the former case, the simplest analysis is to assume that the force of infection was constant over calendar time and age, and consider each person\'s age to be their duration of exposure [13] . More sophisticated models allow for changing force of infection over time, or over age, or even allow for the presence of maternal antibodies if infants are included [4, 14] . Carrying out more than one survey in the same individuals provides more robust estimates of the force of infection during a given study period [4, 7] . Using repeated surveys, rate ratios can be obtained from binomial regression with complementary log-log link and the logarithm of the time between surveys as an offset [13] . While age is used as the time at risk in the analysis of a single survey, in repeated surveys it can be considered a risk factor like any other. However, whatever the number of surveys, errors in test status are usually ignored, whether analysing one or more surveys. In particular, for repeated surveys, individuals testing positive at baseline are usually considered no longer at risk [1, 4, 7] , ignoring the possibility that they were false positives.The choice of assay may substantially affect the study\'s interpretation [15] . Various methods have taken into account certain kinds of test imperfection, for either single or repeated surveys. In particular, Trotter & Gay [16] developed a compartmental model of multiple surveys, in which the force of infection and imperfect sensitivity were estimated for Neisseria meningitidis. For a single survey, Alleman et al. [17] and Hachiya et al. [18] estimated the force of infection, and simultaneously test sensitivity for rubella and measles, by assuming that imperfect sensitivity was the reason for seroprevalence not necessarily reaching 100% at the highest ages. Tan et al. [19] used a model for dengue, in which sensitivity reduces over time as antibody levels decrease, applied to two independent population serosurveys from blood donors. Olive et al. [20] estimated the force of infection for Rift Valley fever based on fixed values of sensitivity and specificity for a single survey.Here we provide methods to estimate force of infection, from a single serosurvey or two serosurveys in the same individuals, accounting for imperfections in sensitivity and/or specificity, and for uncertainty in these parameters.We started from methods for estimating prevalence based on an imperfect diagnostic test, as reviewed by Lewis & Torgerson [21] , and use similar notation. Estimation is done using a Bayesian framework and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [22] . We assume that the immune response being measured is long-lasting so that, for example, apparent seroreversions, i.e. changes over time from positive to negative, are due to test errors, rather than loss of immunity. We use ""seroprevalence"" to mean the proportion of individuals with the underlying immune response, which the diagnostic tests measure with error.For a diagnostic test, the sensitivity is the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified by the test, and the specificity is the proportion of true negatives that are correctly identified by the test [23] . The probability of testing positive (T + ) is specified as a function of the unobserved true status (π), and the assumed values for sensitivity (S e ) and specificity (S p ):ProbðT þ Þ ¼ S e p þ ð1 À S p Þð1 À pÞ Then, representing a constant seroconversion rate, a binomial regression is specified with a complementary log-log link']",Estimating the force of infection is important in public health as it helps quantify the impact of disease control programs and identify regions requiring further measures. It can be accurately measured despite imperfections in serological surveys by using methods that account for sensitivity and specificity errors and by conducting repeated surveys.,multi_context,True
22,"What is the role of neutralizing antibodies in combating SARS-CoV-2 and its potential escape strategies, considering the similarities with SARS-CoV-1?","['Fruitful Neutralizing Antibody Pipeline Brings Hope To Defeat SARS-Cov-2\nThe interaction between the RBD and ACE2 is the first event in cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, and is thus an attractive prospect for the development of therapeutics against COVID-19, both for treating infected patients and for preventing infection [16, 17] . Targeting the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to inhibit its binding to ACE2 can potentially be achieved with limited side effects on surrounding host cells [18] .Cambridge-based Moderna Inc. was the first to launch a vaccine clinical trial, initiating Phase I of their mRNA-based vaccine trial only 67 days (mRNA-1273, Clinical Trial Number i NCT04283461, 16 March 2020) after inception of the program. Promising data from their Phase I trial were recently published in which vaccination induced strong virus-neutralizing activity [19] . The Chinese company CanSino also announced their Phase I study of an adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector carrying the SARS-CoV-2 S protein gene (Ad5-nCoV, NCT04341389) on 16 March 2020, and has since reported significant humoral and specific T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 in their Phase I [20] and II studies [21] . A host of other agents have since emerged, ranging from additional viral vector-and nucleic acid-based designs to protein-based S protein subunit vaccines, as well as the traditional inactivated/attenuated viruses [22] [23] [24] ii .On the therapeutics side, small molecules are receiving significant attention, and N300 candidates are in development, primarily based around the strategy of drug repurposing. Repurposing of remdesivir [25] (initially trialed against Ebola virus, MERS coronavirus, and other RNA viruses [26, 27] ) has recently shown some promising data in a Phase III trial [28] in patients with moderate COVID-19. In another clinical trial (NCT04381936), researchers from the University of Oxford have also reported success with another repurposed drug, dexamethasone (primarily used as a general anti-inflammatory medicine) in reducing the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients [28] . Another treatment option that has shown some promise is convalescent plasma transfer [29] [30] [31] [32] . Despite US FDA approval and widespread use as a therapeutic, a recent report [33] conflicts with earlier studies on the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy, suggesting that this strategy may not confer significant clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients.Although the above highlights a multitude of different paths towards COVID-19 treatments, one class of therapeutics that has not yet shown success are neutralizing antibodies and their functional fragments [18, 34] . We discuss these neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 and highlight how the robust antibody pipeline can help to combat the escape strategies presented by SARS-CoV-2.Genomic identity between the S protein coding sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is 76% [5, 35] . In addition, structural comparisons of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 illustrate a high degree of similarity in overall conformation [9] . Thus, antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 serve as an initial pool of candidates with potentially neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 [36, 37] . In Wrapp et al., the landmark paper highlighting the first solved structure of the prefusion spike of SARS-CoV-2, initial testing of previously established antibodies S230, m396, and 80R against SARS-CoV-1 RBD was conducted, but failed to show any level of binding to SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations as high as 1 μM [16] . In another study, T62, a preparation of polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-1 S1 antibodies, showed potent neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-1, but only limited neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions [38] .Other antibodies such as VHH-72 and S309 (both originally developed for SARS-CoV-1) have shown significant neutralization activity against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Glossary Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2): the target receptor of SARS-CoV-1/2 which is mainly expressed in human vascular endothelial cells and the renal tubular epithelium.

23,"""What are the benefits of using an automated process for extracting defective components in maintenance decision-making, and how can they be visualized in a user interface?""","["" as component-related material and reordering metadata. The participants also recognized that the visual fault explanations could mainly help them localize faults significantly faster as well as develop a thorough comprehension and understanding of the fault. Specifically, it was mentioned that the easier localization could reduce the workload and accelerate the root cause analysis. On the downside, it could hinder independent examination of the images in the long run. The image augmentations consequently provide fault interpretability (DP4). Most significantly, all participants acknowledged that the IB-DSS is especially suitable for improved maintenance decisionmaking, as they would be able to ''work more efficiently, simply work more or even combine activities'' (Epsilon). In fact, besides the planning and scoping of individual Fig. 7 Structure of our user interface with its different views and the transitions between the views maintenance orders, the improved data and information availability and quality enhance four key decision-making tasks: finding and discovering systematic faults (Epsilon, Iota, Lambda), combining maintenance orders (Eta, Epsilon, Kappa), discussing maintenance budget (My, Iota, Ny), and scoping and planning long-term restoration projects (My, Kappa).In this section we depict the contributions and limitations of our work and present an outlook regarding PLC inspection and maintenance.Our results imply that our instantiated IB-DSS enables maintenance engineers to make better, more informed decisions about repairing or replacing PLCs by means of improved data and information quality.More generally, this suggests that the rich information from uniformly acquired images extracted through deeplearning-based image processing capabilities combined with contextual information of metadata and interpretability provided by visual data exploration is a valuable solution to the information intensive context of maintenance and monitoring applications. Figure 8 depicts the schematic layout of these aspects. Consequently, we hypothesize that our derived knowledge provides a nascent design theory for the still underresearched class of IB-DSS. This design knowledge might be particularly valuable for creating automated decision support systems in information-intensive contexts where decision-makers largely rely on unstructured vision-based image data. This in turn would increase the quality of decision both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness (Kraus et al. 2020) .The schematic layout of our conceptualized design principles, as depicted in Fig. 8 , therefore provides prescriptive knowledge that may serve as a blueprint (Gregor and Jones 2007) to develop similar systems for visionbased applications.In our specific use case of PLC inspection, the proposed IB-DSS relying on UAV generated images can provide multiple benefits compared with the status quo. It can prevent accidents since hazardous inspection methods like tower-climbing are no longer necessary -as the inspection of the towers is now performed by unmanned UAVs. While no coherent numbers are available within Europe, recent reports from the US demonstrate that power line work is listed among top 10 most dangerous jobs. Each year, over 40 power line workers receive fatal injuries resulting from falling or electrocution (Schwarz and Drudi 2018) . While certainly only a share of these workers die during inspection activities (rather than the repair activity itself), it is desirable to save every life possible. The non-fatal injuries amount to 1200 per year in the US (Schwarz and Drudi 2018) and the typical reasons are falling, slipping and tripping. We also expect significant reduction of injuries in this area, once automation of inspection is implemented.Currently, the data that MEs work with are tables of compiled inspection reports with heterogeneous assessments of a distributed workforce. The standardized data acquisition and processing results in (1) more reliable and (2) more structured data. Combined with the benefits of a unified interface that provides metadata and latent, information maintenance decisions are fully comprehensible.In total, the participants of the confirmatory workshop affirmed that the IB-DSS enhances their decision-making substantially. As mentioned by Epsilon, Theta, Kappa, and My, besides the pure planning of maintenance orders the artifact could moreover be utilized for other tasks, like the combination of maintenance orders or the planning of longterm restoration projects. While meeting Gregor and Jones 's (2007) six common criteria for design theories, our design knowledge for IB-DSS carries limitations that open opportunities for future research. Our research can only be generalized to a limited extent because it was conducted at one company in the power line infrastructure domain and focused on a selection of defect cases. While we can claim some generalization by supporting our design through kernel theories and other studies, further IB-DSS should be developed for other use cases and in other domains to extend and consolidate the design theory. Furthermore, our research lacks quantification of the effect on the field efficiency of the image processing. Quantitative studies in this regard could be conducted to benchmark the artifact's effects in terms of performance of automated versus manual image processing.Within our presented research, we showed novel ways to design condition-based maintenance systems. More precisely, we utilized images captured by UAVs which were subsequently automatically analyzed and included within"", "" and diagnose PLCs was introduced. Exemplary images (cf. Fig. 3, page 21) were shown to clarify the use case. The interviewees were allowed to ask questions of comprehension. Subsequently, in a semi-structured interview fashion each participant was asked to evaluate the DFs. A detailed overview of the questionnaire can be found in Appendix A3 on page 40. The question of whether each presented DF appropriately addresses its respective DPs served as the starting point. The interviewees opinion and attitude regarding all DFs was explored and probing questions were asked if necessary. This allowed us to assess the attitude of human expert workers towards the technology. This initial evaluation of part of the IB-DSS's tentative design serve as initial mediation to ensure that the final artifact can be designed as a useful and efficient instrument for solving our research question.In accordance with Hevner and Chatterjee 's (2010) suggestion for the analysis of confirmatory focus groups and King 's (1998) general proposal of template analysis for textual data, we adapted the approach for the analysis of the interview transcripts. The artifact's DPs served as the initial coding categories.In general, the interviewees confirmed the usefulness of the way the image acquisition (DP1) is performed and also acknowledged the image processing (DP2) to extract comparable, trustful, and helpful information. They specifically confirmed the usefulness of the vision-based approach for capturing a wide variety of different faults. More significantly, the ability to ''[...] look into the detailed pictures is already of high value'' (Iota) since it is easier to scope maintenance operations from component images rather than plain table entries. Additionally, the interviewees emphasized the good quality of the images as well as the improved perspective to view the PLCs and respective defects, due to the UAVs being able to fly close to the component of interest. Similarly, the functionality to automatically analyze the images for components and their faults was perceived as a major gain and precisely addressed the request of interviewee Zeta: ''It would actually be quite interesting if someone or something evaluates these pictures that the drone captures and then just sends the damage.'' The interviewees stressed several particular factors. First and foremost, the prevention of subjectivity was mentioned, leading to a uniformity in fault diagnosis and consequently to a flawless comparability between faults. Second, besides the presented ability to detect insulators, fittings, birdnests and safetypins, the interviewees assumed that several other components could be added easily. However, in more detail two participants raised doubts about the system's ability to recognize severe incidents such as completely broken and consequently dangling insulators. Finally, six out of the nine participants indicated, without being asked, that they felt there were benefits in using an automated process to extract defective components. They specifically mentioned benefits regarding timeliness, cost, and performance in comparison to the current manual inspection methods. However, although the proposed extraction of faults generated generally positive feedback, the need to ''comprehend: how did this assessment come about'' (Ny) was mentioned. Consequently, both the results and the reasoning of the fault diagnosis require visualization. Supporting MEs based on improved data and information quality requires making them accessible through a UIC. In the following, we describe the UICs' design and evaluation.To create a UIC that accomplishes the preliminary DRs of visualization (DR5) of the network and related defects (Shakhatreh et al. 2019) , we implemented the artifact based on the inferred DPs (cf. Fig. 2 on page 15) using Tableau 6 and Javascript. The artifact integrates two data sources: (1) UAV-captured image data (DP1) and its according metadata (DP3) as well as (2) metadata about the physical objects of the power line infrastructure (DP3) at our case company, such as geographical position or age. Information that is extracted as part of the image processing (cf. Sect. 5.2) is integrated into the artifact (DP2 and DP4). Finally, these building blocks are arranged in a meaningful way to support decision-making through visual data exploration (DP5). Figure 7 depicts the different views and their interactive links along with the respective DFs.To satisfy DP5, the general layout of the UIC should follow the visual exploration paradigm (Shneiderman 1996) and provide overview first, allow for zoom and filter capabilities, and then accommodate details on demand. We base our UIC on four different views which emphasize different task properties in our multidimensional data and maximize the availability of explicit and latent information. View (1) provides an operational dashboard view (DF7) to get a quick and aggregated sense of the condition of the power line infrastructure. View (2) contains a geographical information system view (DF5) to find and inspect adjacent infrastructure items and faults. This allows MEs to explore both the incident location to determine maintenance order specifics as well as further incidents which can be bundled""]","The benefits of using an automated process for extracting defective components in maintenance decision-making include prevention of subjectivity, uniformity in fault diagnosis, comparability between faults, timeliness, cost-effectiveness, and improved performance compared to manual inspection methods.

24,What does OqxB do to form a functional complex and give antibiotic resistance against many antibiotics?,"[' over-expressed in E. coli C43(DE3)-ΔacrB, the MIC experiments confirmed its role in the extrusion of other common antibiotics with high efflux liability like linezolid and novobiocin ( Table 2 ). This suggests that OqxB can form a functional complex with the E. coli AcrA-TolC and further confirm its role in conferring antibiotic resistance against a wide spectrum of antibiotics, as reported elsewhere 54 . It can also be noted that the fluoroquinolone resistance due to efflux by AcrB is less as compared to that caused by OqxB.Binding mode determination of fluoroquinolones with OqxB by docking and MD simulations. To ascertain the binding mode of OqxB with the three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin), a computational molecular docking approach followed by MD simulations was utilized. Residues around the DDM1 molecule were considered as binding pocket residues to generate the grid for docking simulations. All three fluoroquinolones arrived at a consistent binding mode at the substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 5) . The fluoroquinolone carbonyl group interacts with the S182 main chain amino group (Fig. 5A , B, C) and the quinolone aromatic ring makes pi-cation interaction with the R157 guanidino side chain ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ).A positively charged group of the fluoroquinolone molecules enter into a hydrophilic pocket near the exit funnel and forms hydrogen bond interaction with the E50 side chain ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S7 ). The OqxB hydrophilic pocket constitutes three negatively charged (E50, D87, and E184), as well as three positively charged residues (R48, R157, and R774). This highly charged OqxB hydrophilic pocket is another remarkable difference that is not observed in any other RND efflux pumps ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S7 ). The corresponding pocket in AcrB and MexB possess few charged residues and are majorly composed of hydrophilic residues like serine and threonine (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Fig. S8 ). MD simulations initiated for membrane-embedded OqxB trimer with 6 DDM molecules were stable ( Supplementary  Fig. S9 ) with backbone RMSD (root mean square deviation) within 3 Å. Moreover, Q46 and Q134 side chains can consistently interact with both the DDM molecules ( Supplementary Fig. S10 and S11) as observed in the crystal structure. Hydrogen bond analyses of three DDM1 molecules (from all three protomers), revealed that they could form several hydrogen bond interactions with pocket residues (Supplementary Fig. S10 ) due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups on maltoside sugar rings. Though the structures were identical, variations were observed in the hydrogen bond interaction pattern of DDM molecules due to minor side-chain orientation differences, as well as its flexible nature.To avoid variations caused by side chain differences in protomers, an alternative approach was followed to generate an initial OqxB trimer complex with a ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) molecule. OqxB trimer was constructed by superimposing a Fig. S9 ), while slightly elevated RMSDs were observed for CIPRO molecules compared to the molecular docking binding orientation ( Supplementary Fig. S12A ). Intra-molecular interactions between the important charge residues pairs (E50:R774 and R157:E184) showed stable interactions consistent with the crystal structure ( Supplementary Fig. S12B ). Inter-molecular interactions of CIPRO molecules with substrate-binding pocket residues within the three individual protomers (Supplementary Fig. S12C ) showed 2-4 hydrogen bond interactions. All the three CIPRO molecules altered their orientations such that they interact with the R157 residue guanidino side chain. The negatively charged carboxyl and the fluoroquinolone carbonyl group of ligands formed two stable hydrogen bond interactions (>80% occupancy) with the R157 side chain (Supplementary Fig. S12C ). More indepth analyses are reported below the Supplementary Fig. S12 . This evidence indicates that the CIPRO molecules interact with OqxB substrate-binding pocket, predominantly via the hydrophilic portion of the pocket, which is composed of residues, E50 and R157. To validate the proposed binding mode determined by computational methods and establish the role of key charged residues of OqxB (R157 and E50) in fluoroquinolone binding, we performed point mutation studies.

A recent survey in Jordan showed that most pharmacists (55.8%) get their source of information in response to COVID-19 from social media. In Abdelmalek and Mousa contrast, low percentages get their source of information from either the WHO site (6.0%) or scientific journals (5.2%). 31 Since social media containing misinformation or myths increased during the COVID pandemic, general people or professionals started to believe in what they read. 15 One of these myths is that ""antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating new coronavirus."" Thus, it is not unusual for more than half of pharmacists to believe in that statement. Furthermore, the present study showed that less experienced pharmacists believed less that AZM could treat COVID-19 disease and believed more of the negative consequences of using AZM in viral infections. Such belief led them to stock less AZM in their Pharmacy during the pandemic. These results may suggest that fresh pharmacy graduates have more assurance that antibiotics should not be used for viral infections unless preventing secondary bacterial infection. On the other hand, the more experienced pharmacist may tend to go with the flow and believe what they read on social media over the scientific knowledge gained during studying their degree. 15, 31, 32 The latter opens the need for continuous education for pharmacists. Since antibiotic misuse has been high for decades, antibiotic resistance has been of significant concern in developing and developed countries. 15, 16, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] In Jordan, for instance, 73% of Cutibacterium acnes isolated from patients with acne were resistant to erythromycin, 59% to clindamycin, 37% to doxycycline and tetracycline, and 31% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, in a study conducted in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) on 504 healthy college students in Jordan, the researchers found that 40.4% of students carried methicillin-resistant Staphylococci isolated from nasal and skin areas. 37 These isolates were 46% resistant to cefoxitin, 35% to erythromycin, 13% to ciprofloxacin, 12% to nitrofurantoin, and 10% to gentamicin, but not to hospital-restricted injection-type antibiotics, amikacin (1.5%) and vancomycin (0.5%). 37 These results indicate the consequence of the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in Jordan.The concern for developing more antibiotic-resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be significant since the AZM (and other antibiotics) misuse and overuse is two to three folds higher, as presented herein and in other studies. 22, 27 Therefore, new measures of clinical guidelines on using AZM and other antibiotics for COVID-19 patients in Jordan and other countries are warranted. 22, 27, 36 Furthermore, these new measures should be distributed on social media to overcome and balance the false information that the public and the health practitioners are receiving.The present study has limitations. Firstly, although the number of required pharmacies was statistically sufficient, the sample size may not represent the whole pharmacies in Jordan. Secondly, other antibiotics could also be highly used during the pandemic in Jordan. Thirdly, the study included a few sociodemographic variables, whereby more variables might clarify the outcome better.In conclusion, this study demonstrated that AZM is misused by physicians, pharmacists, and the public in Jordan. Since AZM efficacy on SARS-CoV-2 is scarce, there is a need for new guidelines by governmental health authorities to implement strict enforcement of AZM dispensing during COVID-19 to avoid negative consequences of bacterial resistance.The authors declare no conflicts of interest for this work. ']","The misuse of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan is caused by the belief that antibiotics can treat COVID-19, which is spread through social media and misinformation.

27,How has the pandemic affected workload and gender disparities among gig economy teachers at Skyeng?,"["" accentuate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on gender inequality in the gig economy. The pandemic was associated with both the growth of the gig economy (i.e., an increase in the number of average daily tasks/jobs posted on digital platforms 53 ) and challenges for women's advancement and professional development 54 . We argue that these shifts in the work landscape in the gig economy require attention and analysis.Social change facilitated by the spread of gig economy has an impact on a variety of human life spheres besides the labour market. One of them is the environmental factor. The majority of gig economy workers complete their tasks in a remote regime on their own devices (e.g. in the case of Skyeng teachers they give lessons from their computers) and they have no need to commute. Common sense says that such a working organization has a lower environmental impact than in-person office working style. Besides, in contrast to traditional employment, the gig economy does not require employees' in-person presence; consequently, there is no need for them to commute. Such remote working might have a positive impact on global emission. According to D' Almeida et al. 55 transport accounts for 40% of global emissions, and a large share of transport emissions emanates from commuting. Agent-based modeling demonstrated 56 that by intensifying remote work to 2 or 3 days a week, nitrogen dioxide concentrations are reduced, on average, over 4% and 8%, respectively. Notably, remote work might be a key tool in alleviating traffic congestion during peak time in addition to air quality improvement. Although distant employment might be considered as an instrument toward sustainability, some scholars suggest that such working organization might have two-fold environmental effect. Shreedar et al. 57 considered a set of environmentally relevant individual behaviour effects of working from home on energy consumption, travel, technology use and waste behaviour. They outlined the duality of the remote regime on sustainability. For instance, remote workers might be active in their non-working travel which is associated with larger emissions. Alternatively remote workers might be more active digital technology users which is also associated with larger emission. Additionally, gig economy employers cannot control the quality of the laptops or PCs that individuals use for their work. This discussion shows that growth of the gig economy and new forms of employment and working impact a wide range of life spheres and it is important to empirically analyze the evolution of the labour market from different perspectives. Skyeng is the largest online English-language school in Eastern Europe (https:// skyeng. eu/). All lessons are conducted via the Vimbox platform. The lessons are standardized and the teachers, as well as the students, are provided with all the related materials. Skyeng hires both native and non-native English speakers for teaching positions. In the case of non-native speakers, the school prefers to hire teachers who have TEFL, CELTA, or DELTA certificates. Job-seekers must complete an audio interview and give a test lesson. Successful candidates must also complete a short probatory period. On admission teachers have to open at least 12 hourly slots for the lessons in their schedule. However, they are allowed to adjust their workload and working hours accordingly afterward.The payment for the lesson is fixed by the platform. A student buys a package of lessons and pays only for their number. The teacher's remuneration is made for each lesson and directly depends on the number of lessons in a given period. When the lesson is finished, the teacher's payment is transferred to a virtual account. The teachers can withdraw the money from the virtual account to their bank account biweekly.Any person in the world is able to register on the Skyeng platform as a student. Upon registration on the platform, students have to pass an admission interview with the manager in order to assess the level of English language proficiency, set the study goals, identify personal interests and find out the time preferences. Afterward, the Skyeng automated recommendation system provides a student with a set of available teachers to select from. For each teacher, the system shows a teacher's photo, personal interests, location and a short bio in text and audio formats.Both students and teachers are able to cancel and/or postpone separate lessons and/or terminate their partnership at any time.This article covers automatically collected log data on English lessons given to adult students from January 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020. Our data set consists of 6,461,404 lessons given by 13,571 teachers to 216,285 students. We considered completed lessons only (87.2% of all planned lessons). We include information regarding teachers' self-reported gender and birth date. The Skyeng system also gathers information on teachers' time zones. Figure 7 shows the dynamics of the absolute number of unique teachers in the data set. Most of the teachers were female (80%) and this proportion slightly changed over time (Fig. 8) . Information of age with respect to "", ' affected by social desirability bias, and vulnerable to memory error [41] [42] [43] . In contrast, digital trace data offer detailed real-time observation of individual actions 43 , as well as enable retrospective data collection. In this paper, we use information about exact paid working hours of online school teachers. Besides the workload, which plays a primary role in their earnings, teachers\' financial compensation in this online school has been a complex function of multiple adjacent factors, such as platform experience and student satisfaction. Since we do not have information on the exact size of teachers\' financial compensation, we focus exclusively on their workload in this paper.Our analysis addresses a set of three research questions. Based on previous findings on women\'s lower workload in traditional jobs 4, 16 , we hypothesize that this tendency might also hold in the gig economy. Conversely, the flexibility online platforms have come to provide through gig economy jobs might diminish the motherhood penalty 33 . Hence, we arrive at our first research question: RQ1: Are there statistically significant disparities in workload between the male and female gig economy teachers?Since workload has been directly associated with pay in this type of work, the answer to RQ1 could help explain the gender pay gap 30 . Less is known about changes in the gender gap over individuals\' life cycles. Goldin 33 demonstrated that while men and women began their employment with relatively similar earnings, the gender pay gap soon widened in men\'s favor, then narrowed as individuals reached their forties. In other words, the disparity in earnings between male and female workers significantly increased during their first few decades of working life. This gap could be related to a lack of human capital accumulation during the childbirth period 44 . In traditional jobs, whitecollar women reported higher levels of stress than men, and this level increased with the number of children. Moreover, the peak of this stress was reached in the period of 35-39 years 45 . Gupta and Smith 44 suggested that ""flexible work-time scheduling, part-time work, home-based work or work-sharing during leaves may be solutions to the problems of depreciation of human capital and the loss of human capital accumulation associated with leave periods"".In the present study, we gauge the gender gap among gig economy workers in different age groups, which leads to our second research question:RQ2: Are there statistically significant disparities in workload among the men and women in different age groups?Finally, workload disparities between men and women could be related to time arrangements during the workday. Unlike traditional work, the gig economy theoretically allows individuals to organize their work hours conveniently around their routine. Women have been less likely than men to work evenings due to caregiving and housework responsibilities 4, 15 , and the gig economy gives them the opportunity to work at more suitable times. Our third research question is thus as follows:RQ3: Are there statistically significant disparities in the distribution of work hours between men and women? In this article, we consider the data on more than 6 millions English lessons given to adult students over the 78-weeks period from January 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020. We analysed only completed lessons (87.2% of all planned lessons). The data includes information regarding teachers\' self-reported gender and birth date.

28,"""What is the connection between viral loads, cytokine storm, and JAK inhibitors in COVID-19?""","[' precise molecular link between high viral loads and aberrant cytokine/chemokine induction leading to the cytokine storm remains to be determined. Appearance of the cytokine storm is correlated with a decrease in lymphocytes, eosinophils, increase in D-dimers and importantly with an emergency myelopoiesis that generates insufficiently differentiated or skewed monocytic and granulocytic cells.The SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts both lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis. COVID-19 patients exhibit a decrease in the number of plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells, different monocyte distribution subsets and activation patterns, as well as neutrophil phenotypic alterations. 46 During COVID-19, defects in myelopoiesis occur with profound alterations of the myeloid compartment. [46] [47] [48] In mild forms of COVID-19, inflammatory monocytes (HLA-DRhiCD11chiCD14+) with an IFNstimulated gene signature are elevated. 48 In severe forms, HLA-DR Low monocytes are present along with neutrophil precursors and dysfunctional mature neutrophils. 48 Using single cell RNA sequencing of purified cell populations from COVID-19 patients it was demonstrated that while HLA-DR Low classical monocytes accumulate during severe disease, non-classical CD14 Low CD16 High monocytes disappear. 47 In severe cases, classical monocytes release high levels of S100A8/S100A9, also called calprotectin. 47 In addition, immunosuppressive CD10 Low CD101 -CXCR4 +/neutrophils are produced, that migrate to the lung. High levels of S100A8/S100A9 and altered frequency of non-classical monocytes are becoming markers of severe disease. 47 However, the relationship between classic and non-classic monocytes is more complex. 49 These changes in the myeloid and lymphoid compartments are a pivotal reason for further pathological mechanisms mediated by these cells at the level of lung pneumocytes and endothelial cells. It is important to emphasize that all step-by-step mechanistic details of these chains of events are still worked out, but what is certain is that while corticosteroid therapy is very useful, it is not sufficient to interrupt the immunopathology of severe of COVID-19.During a controlled viral infection, early innate mechanisms executed by monocytes, NK cells and cytokines act to induce late adaptive immunity. 50 Viral load peaks during the descending phase of the early innate response and coincides with the peak of development of adaptive response, then both viral load and intensity of adaptive response decrease, with virus becoming undetectable, while the adaptive response develops the long-term memory protection. In an uncontrolled infection there is persistent or delayed innate response with cytotoxicity, lymphopenia and immunosuppression. Mediators of toxicity during the delayed pathological immune response are IL-6, IL-1 and several other cytokines. Attempts to control these events using IL-6 or IL-1 blockers and corticosteroid therapy have led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and WHO to indicate IL-6R blocker tocilizumab (and sarilumab) 51-55 and IL-1 blocker anakinra (EMA only) 56 57 in certain severe cases of COVID-19. These strategies would need to be compared with the use of JAK inhibitors (JAKi), but at present direct comparisons have not been performed.There are two major reasons why JAKs became prime targets of the pharmaceutical industry for inhibition. The first is that, in 2005, a unique somatic acquired JAK2 mutation (JAK2 V617F) was discovered to be responsible for 70% of a large group of myeloid cancers called myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). [58] [59] [60] [61] This was a surprizing finding. Within MPNs, 95% of Polycythemia Vera (PV) and >60% of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (MF) were linked to this acquired mutations. 3% of PV are harboring a different set of JAK2 mutations in exon 12, where insertions or deletions lead to mutation of K539 in the linker between Open access SH2 and pseudokinase domains, also inducing JAK2 persistent activation. 62 The rest of ET and MF patients that do not harbor JAK2 V617F exhibit mutations that induce unusual modes of activation of TpoR that lead to persistent JAK2 activation. 63 One is represented by mutations in TpoR (MPL) itself, 64-67 the other is frameshifting mutations in calreticulin', 'Open access JAK inhibitors and COVID-19\nDuring SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response can be inhibited or delayed, and the subsequent persistent viral replication can induce emergency signals that may culminate in a cytokine storm contributing to the severe evolution of COVID-19. Cytokines are key regulators of the immune response and virus clearance, and, as such, are linked to the-possibly altered-response to the SARS-CoV-2. They act via a family of more than 40 transmembrane receptors that are coupled to one or several of the 4 Janus kinases (JAKs) coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Once activated, JAKs act on pathways for either survival, proliferation, differentiation, immune regulation or, in the case of type I interferons, antiviral and antiproliferative effects. Studies of graft-versus-host and systemic rheumatic diseases indicated that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) exert immunosuppressive effects that are non-redundant with those of corticotherapy. Therefore, they hold the potential to cut-off pathological reactions in COVID-19. Significant clinical experience already exists with several JAKi in COVID-19, such as baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and nezulcitinib, which were suggested by a meta-analysis (Patoulias et al.) to exert a benefit in terms of risk reduction concerning major outcomes when added to standard of care in patients with COVID-19. Yet, only baricitinib is recommended in first line for severe COVID-19 treatment by the WHO, as it is the only JAKi that has proven efficient to reduce mortality in individual randomized clinical trials (RCT), especially the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) and COV-BARRIER phase 3 trials. As for secondary effects of JAKi treatment, the main caution with baricitinib consists in the induced immunosuppression as long-term side effects should not be an issue in patients treated for COVID-19. We discuss whether a class effect of JAKi may be emerging in COVID-19 treatment, although at the moment the convincing data are for baricitinib only. Given the key role of JAK1 in both type I IFN action and signaling by cytokines involved in pathogenic effects, establishing the precise timing of treatment will be very important in future trials, along with the control of viral replication by associating antiviral molecules.Cytokine receptors and the Janus kinase-signal transducers and Activators of transcription pathway Cytokines are alpha-helical proteins of [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] aminoacids that are secreted and act on target cells as a function of expression and exposure on their surface of specific receptors. They are fundamentally required for blood formation and regulation of the immune response. In blood formation, on commitment to differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), lineage specific cytokines regulate the survival, proliferation and differentiation of progenitors and the final blood levels. 1 Cytokines act via specific cytokine receptors. The human genome codes for over 40 cytokine receptors. They all signal via Janus kinases (JAKs), initially called Just Another Kinases, that are appended non-covalently to their cytosolic tails. Four JAKs are coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Activated receptors induce via JAKs the activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). There are 7 STATs coded by the human genome. Several receptors use the same JAKs and sharing of JAKs allows specific signals by the different receptors and cytokines, but different outputs. 1 The cytokine receptor superfamily is divided in type 1 and type 2 families (figure 1) and this distinction is derived from different sequence features, such as conserved WSXWS motifs in the extracellular domains and boxes 1 and 2 motifs in the cytosolic domains for type 1 (figure 2A). 1 The type 1 family consists of homodimeric receptors (for Epo, Tpo, GCSF, Growth Hormone, Prolactin), heterodimeric receptors (for IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF), using JAK2, hetero-oligomeric receptors, using JAK1 and to some extent JAK2 and TYK2 (represented by the IL6 family receptors), 2 and finally the gamma chain using receptors (namely those for IL']","The connection between viral loads, cytokine storm, and JAK inhibitors in COVID-19 is that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response can be inhibited or delayed, leading to persistent viral replication.

Cytokines, which are key regulators of the immune response and virus clearance, act via Janus kinases (JAKs) to activate pathways for survival, proliferation, differentiation, and immune regulation. JAK inhibitors (JAKi) exert immunosuppressive effects that can cut off pathological reactions in COVID-19. Baricitinib, a JAKi, has been proven efficient in reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients.

29,What is the role of C5a-C5aR axis in tumor cell progression and how does IL-1β contribute?,"[' et al. reported that blockade of the C5a-C5aR1 axis resulted in a substantial improvement in the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies against lung cancer growth and metastasis through CXCL16-mediated effects. 29 We demonstrated high expression of CCL2 but no difference in CCL7 or CX3CL1 expression in MPE compared with transudate plural effusion (Figure 3 Compared with other monocyte subsets, intermediate monocytes in humans express higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, 30, 31 which promotes the progression of tumors. 32 However, the role of cytokines released by intermediate monocytes in MPE needs to be further elucidated. Our data showed a significant increase in IL-1β expression in MPE supernatant and a higher level of IL-1β secretion in intermediate monocytes isolated from MPE (Figure 4(a),(b) ). Consistent with a previous in vitro study in neutrophils, 33 our data showed that C5a has the potential to induce the generation of LPS-stimulated IL-1β in intermediate monocytes (Figure 4(c) , (d)). Collectively, our results demonstrated that the C5a-C5aR axis not only regulates the infiltration of intermediate monocytes into the pleural cavity, but also increases the proportion of IL-1β-releasing intermediate monocytes, which participate in the immune response in MPE.Although C5a has been reported to be an essential mediator of inflammation-induced tumorigenesis, little information is known about its role in the progression of tumor cells. 17 We found that C5a induced A549 cell proliferation in lung cancer, which was consistent with the findings of Chen et al. 20 Chen et al. also proved that the C5a-C5aR pathway participates in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer via activation of the PI3K/AKT axis. 19 Similarly, our results showed that C5a treatment led to a highly significant increase in the levels of p-AKT. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor LY29f4002 was reported to inhibit A549 proliferation in the presence of C5a ( Figure 5(d) ,(e)). Thus, it is plausible to suggest that C5a-C5aR signaling regulates the proliferation of lung carcinoma cells via PI3K/AKT axis activation. Some reports have indicated that the C5a-C5aR axis decreases apoptosis in several cell types, such as neutrophils, 34 T cells, 35 and macrophages. 36 Our current study suggested that the C5a-C5aR axis could protect lung cancer cells from DDP-induced apoptosis ( Figure 5 (h),(i)). The migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of tumor cells are also important factors influencing tumor metastasis. Our data revealed that C5a facilitated the migration and invasion of lung carcinoma cells ( Figure 5 (j),(k)). Additionally, C5a was reported to promote the intercellular adhesion of A549 cells to PMCs ( Figure 5 (l),(m)), consistent with previous studies, which proved that C5a was the principal initiator of neutrophil adhesion by regulating cell adhesion molecules. 37 Furthermore, the C5a axis showed a similar role in promoting EMT in A549 cells ( Figure 5 (n)) as it did in renal tubular epithelial cells. 38 Overall, our study revealed that C5a exerted a tumor-promoting effect by inducing the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of A549 cells and inhibiting the apoptosis of tumor cells, while C5aRA significantly reversed these effects.IL-1β has emerged as a key component of tumorpromoting inflammation by shaping different elements of the tumor microenvironment, including cancer cell proliferation, 32,39 migration, and metastasis. 32, 40 Based on our data showing that C5a has the ability to induce IL-1β secretion from intermediate monocytes, we attempted to explore the role of IL-1β overexpression stimulated by C5a. Here, we demonstrated that the IL-1β/IL-1R axis could promote the proliferation of A549 cells in vitro (Figure 6(a) , (b)), which was consistent with previous studies on human natural killer cells and glioblastoma cells. 41 We also found a tendency towards the upregulation of MAPK/p-MAPK expression in A549 cells after IL-1β treatment (Figure 6(c) ), but further study is needed to confirm whether the MAPK signaling pathway is the main mechanism by which IL-1β induces the growth of tumor cells. According to previous studies, the IL-1β/IL-1R axis is also a regulator of apoptosis in several cell types. 42 Our study reached a similar']","The C5a-C5aR axis regulates the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of tumor cells.

As in the pre-pandemic period, during the COVID-19 pandemic period, the radiological differential diagnosis of other viral agents that cause pneumonia in patients with normal immunity or in immunosuppressed patients with seasonal epidemics has gained importance in early diagnosis and isolation.Therefore, it was aimed to investigate the difference between CT imaging findings defined as characteristic in COVID-19 pneumonia and CT findings detected in pneumonia due to other viral agents previously encountered..

31,What is the impact of IL-1β on A549 cell apoptosis and the role of C5a in this process?,"['RA (Figure 6(h) ). As shown in Figure 6 (i), IL-1β strongly enhanced the adhesion of A549 cells to the PMC monolayer, while IL-1RA abrogated the adhesion capability. As indicated in the Western blot results in Figure 6 (j), IL-1β increased the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, whereas it had no effect on E-cadherin. IL-1RA had the opposite effect on EMT markers compared with IL-1β.In previous studies, we reported that the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a could enhance the homing of nonclassical monocytes to the pleural cavity by the chemokine axis in The protein levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin were detected by Western blot (n = 3). *Versus. control group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. # Versus C5a group, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01. & Versus C5aRA group, & p < 0.05, && p < 0.01 tuberculosis pleural effusion (TPE). 21 In the present study, we extended our previous work and demonstrated that the activation of C5a in MPE induced the recruitment of intermediate monocytes and played an essential role in the progression of MPE.In the context of cancer, complement C3a and C5a, which leads to tumor-promoting chronic inflammation in the majority of the studied mouse models, are continually generated. 23 However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of the complement system, especially C3a and C5a, in MPE remain unknown. In the present study, we observed activation of the classical and alternative pathways, while little presence of the MBL pathway in malignant pleurisy tissue (Figure 2) , which is different from tuberculous pleurisy. 21 Li et al. elucidated an unknown feature of MBL function in suppressing tumor development. 24 Consistent with their results, we also detected no MBL expression in MPE, indicating that in advanced tumors, low or even no MBL expression is favorable to tumor development and promotes tumor growth. Considering the differential activation of the complement pathway in MPE and TPE, the expressions of complement factors in pleural effusion might be a promising diagnostic marker. In the present study, we detected high activation of C5a and low levels of C3a, both by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Our data were consistent with those reported by Bulla and colleagues, 15 which revealed a strong signal for C1q in lung adenocarcinoma and mild expression of C3. Thus, the activation of the classical and alternative pathways is increased in MPE and may be responsible for the high level of C5a. Because C5a is a strong chemoattractant for inflammatory cells, the major focus of this study was to explore the role of C5a and monocytes in MPE progression.Emerging evidence indicates that monocytes contribute to carcinogenesis by releasing inflammatory mediators. 25 Wang et al. reported that the CD163 + CD14 + and CD206 + CD14 + cell frequencies in MPE were markedly higher than those in benign pleural effusion, and these CD14 positive cells could potentially be used as an immune diagnostic marker for MPE. 26, 27 However, the authors did not analyze the subtype of monocytes in MPE. In agreement with Wang et al. our data also revealed that the portion of monocytes was higher in MPE, showing significant increases compared to those in the blood (Figure 1(a),(b) ). In addition, we demonstrated that CD14 ++ CD16 À classical monocytes were decreased in malignant pleurisy patients, while CD14 + CD16 + nonclassical and CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes were significantly increased in MPE, which was different from the observations in TPE. 21 Interestingly, the proportion of CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes in MPE was 12 times higher than that in peripheral blood (Figure 1(c) , (d)). However, it is unclear how these accumulating intermediate monocytes enter the pleural cavity and whether they promote the progression of MPE.Monocytes were found to be recruited by complement C5a through the increased secretion of chemokines, including CCL2, in severe COVID-19 patients. 28 Our previous results also demonstrated that C5a mediated the infiltration of monocytes into the pleural cavity by inducing the expression of chemokines (CCL2, CCL7 and CX3CL1) released by PMCs in TPE. 21 These studies indicated that C5a was a strong chemoattractant for monocytes.

32,"What challenges do healthcare professionals face during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically regarding cancer patients and the mental impact on staff?","[""going re-shuffling and re-allocating of resource (human and budget) which puts additional strain on existing services that were already at full capacity. Figures from China's National Health Commission demonstrated that more than 3300 healthcare workers were infected, and 22 had died related to COVID-19 [40] . As the pandemic accelerates providing PPE to deliver safe oncology services is a key concern worldwide [12] . If acute care services are at maximum capacity, institutions may provide alternative provisions for the care of people affected by cancer. Therefore, oncology nurses will need to be flexible to facilitate the safe delivery of alternative models of care. Alternative and adaptive models of care could increase the use of community care or private facilities.Following an analysis of nationwide data in China, a number of major strategies were put forward in the clinical management of cancer during this COVID-19 crisis [12] . First, that of intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery for people with low risk cancers. Second, should surgery suites and personnel be seconded elsewhere or are unavailable, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be considered for timely delivery of oncologic manoeuvres for some malignancies. Hypofractionated radiotherapy protocols should be prescribed whenever possible [41] , including single fraction treatments for uncomplicated bone metastases [42] . Third, protective approaches such as PPE and personal space modifications should be considered, see Table 3 . During chemotherapy administration, treatment beds or chairs should be placed with adequate space (1.5 meters) to prevent close contact as much as possible. Limiting or eliminating family attendance, while stressful, may be necessary in limited chemotherapy suite spaces. In such cases, portable technology such as smart phones or iPads could be loaned during the treatment session for patient and family support and subsequently disinfected between patient usage. Finally, more intensive surveillance during and in the recovery period should be considered when patients with cancer are infected with COVID-19, especially older patients and those with multiple co-morbidities [12] .People affected by cancer with family members or those in close contact who are infected, or suspected with COVID-19, should isolate from these contacts. Patients in such circumstances should be advised to inform their cancer care centre of any quarantine requirements. It is important that current health department recommendations regarding isolation and quarantine are followed. All cancer centres should display the symptoms of COVID-19 disease, criteria for when medical advice should be sought, and state the appropriate mode of presentation. For example, services may use a telephone triage, dedicated COVID-19 community assessment clinics [43] while some countries have built new COVID-19 hospitals within a very short timeframe with isolation and testing facilities.When facing a large-scale public health event, such as COVID-19, the physical and psychological strain on healthcare professionals cannot be underestimated [44] . It has been documented that the main concerns from healthcare staff during the COVID-19 outbreak in China have included being afraid of bringing the virus to their home and families [45] . Staff articulated a lack of support in how to manage patients when they were unwilling to be quarantined at the hospital, or when patients did not cooperate with medical measures because of panic [45] . Finally, staff articulated concerns about the shortage of PPE and feelings of incapability when faced with critically ill patients [45] and difficult decision-making in the allocation continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and ventilators.Experiences of health professionals during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak indicate a sequel of depression, anxiety, fear, frustration [46] and post-traumatic stress [44] .Research is currently underway looking into the mental impact of working in the frontline with people infected by COVID-19. Initial data from a large sample (n=1257) in China suggest similar patterns, with half of the sample of frontline staff experiencing depression and anxiety [47] . In fact, being a female nurse indicated a higher risk for depression, anxiety and psychological distress [47] .Caring for deteriorating patients across all ages increases emotional strain and physical exhaustion [48] . This experience can be exacerbated when caring for people with cancer; additional burden is placed on overworked nursing staff as the focus shifts to life-preservation leaving no space for reflection. Re-allocation of the workforce to manage the pandemic can also increase feelings of anxiety due to potential lack of familiarity the new role [30] . These factors can result in suppressing the natural process of grief and loss and in the long-term may lead to faster professional burnout [48] .Anxiety and depression are two of the most commonly experienced effects of cancer and its treatment [49] ; these can be heightened in the face of an additional life-threatening condition such as COVID-19. Frontline staff are also concerned on how best to identify and manage mental health problems of patients infected by COVID-19, but also keep supporting those with pre-existing mental""]","Healthcare professionals face challenges such as re-shuffling and re-allocating resources, strain on existing services, providing safe oncology services, flexible delivery of alternative models of care, intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery, use of hypofractionated radiotherapy, protective approaches such as PPE and personal space modifications, intensive surveillance for infected cancer patients, isolation and quarantine requirements, physical and psychological strain on healthcare professionals, fear of bringing the virus home, lack of support in managing patients, shortage of PPE, mental impact on staff including depression, anxiety, fear, frustration, and post-traumatic stress.",reasoning,True
33,"What is the role of animal models in developing influenza vaccines for humans, considering different animal species' limitations and advantages in terms of infection and immunity to influenza A and B viruses?","['The Role of Animal Models In Influenza Vaccine Research\nInfluenza is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Orthomyxoviridae consist of four genera: influenza A, influenza B, influenza C and Thogoto viruses. The proteins of influenza A viruses are encoded by genes on eight RNA segments. Influenza A viruses are widely distributed in nature and can infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, including humans. Influenza A virus subtypes are classified on the basis of the antigenicity of their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [1, 2] into 16 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes, and all of these subtypes have been found to infect birds [2, 3] . Waterfowl and shorebirds are the natural reservoirs of AI viruses.In their natural hosts, most AI infections are not associated with clinical disease, and the viruses are generally thought to be in evolutionary stasis [4] . In humans, relatively few subtypes of influenza A viruses have caused sustained outbreaks of disease; viruses bearing H1, H2, and H3 HA genes and N1 and N2 NA genes have circulated in the human population during the twentieth century. H1N1 viruses appeared in 1918 and circulated until 1957, when they were replaced by H2N2 viruses. These, in turn, were replaced in 1968 by H3N2 viruses, which continue to circulate. In 1977, H1N1 viruses reappeared and have continued to co-circulate with the H3N2 viruses. Influenza A and B viruses continue to cause epidemics in humans each winter.In addition to the seasonal influenza epidemics, the potential also exists for an influenza pandemic at any time. A pandemic occurs when an influenza strain with a novel HA subtype (with or without a novel NA subtype) appears and spreads in a susceptible human population. In the twentieth century, influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968 , and most recently, in 2009, with the emergence of the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. The influenza pandemic of 1918 was associated with severe morbidity and significant mortality but the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 were milder [5] . To date, disease caused by the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus does not appear to be more severe than disease seen with epidemic influenza, but there is a significant difference in the age groups most affected, with the majority of cases of pandemic 2009 H1N1 infection and hospitalization occurring in children and young adults and the highest mortality occurring in adults aged 24-49 years.AI viruses in their natural reservoir in waterfowl and shorebirds are one source from which novel HA and NA subtypes are introduced into the human population. An influenza virus with a novel HA and/or NA can be introduced into the human population by direct spread from either wild birds or domestic poultry, as was seen when an H5N1 AI virus infected humans in 1997 [6] . Alternatively, avian and human influenza viruses can reassort, generating a virus that can efficiently spread in humans, as happened in the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemics [7] . The pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is derived from influenza viruses that were circulating in pigs rather than birds. This virus is a reassortant, bearing gene segments that were originally derived from avian, human and classical swine influenza viruses [8] .Influenza A viruses also infect and cause disease in a wide variety of mammalian species, including swine, horses, ferrets, mink, dogs, seals, and whales. The currently circulating highly pathogenic AI H5N1 viruses that emerged in Asia in 2003 can also infect and cause lethal infection in felids, including tigers, leopards and domestic cats [9, 10] .Although several animal species can be infected with influenza A viruses naturally and experimentally, an ideal animal model for studying infection and immunity to human influenza has not been identified. Several animal species are permissive to infection with influenza A and B viruses to varying degrees and some exhibit clinical signs of illness and pathological changes in the respiratory tract that are similar to those seen in human influenza. In this chapter, we discuss the main features of the animal models used for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, their advantages and disadvantages, and their contribution to research on vaccines against influenza in humans. We also discuss the role of animal models in the development of vaccines against pandemic influenza. Veterinary vaccines for swine, equine, avian and canine influenza can be evaluated in their natural hosts and are not discussed.Vaccines have been available for epidemic or ""seasonal"" influenza since the 1940s. Inactivated influenza virus vaccines are still largely the same as they were when first developed.

Studies with MAbs established with the apathogenic strain NDV-D26 (genotype 2.I.1.1) established three different epitopes sensitive for both HI and NI activity of MAbs and mapped these sites to different amino acids when escape variants were analyzed [34] . Likewise HI-positive MAb AVS-I, raised against the avirulent LaSota vaccine strain (genotype 2.II) [35] mapped to aa residue 570 that was close to but not part of the other described epitopes [36] . This indicates that NDV strains might express at least slightly different neutralizing epitope patterns. Information for such epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII is not available.In order to characterize antigenic sites of circulating NDV genotype 2.VII, we generated genotype-specific MAbs that are able to block biologically active sites of the HN protein, i.e. antibodies that are able to neutralize infectivity and/or block HA activity. For this approach biophysically enriched HN protein fraction of purified virus proved to be an efficient antigen and the applied Concanavalin A (ConA)-ELISA technique that binds antigen not directly on the plate but coupled by the lectin, provided a high throughput system suitable to detect antibodies to conformation sensitive sites. The resulting MAbs were used to recognize unique neutralizing epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII.NDV strain chicken/EGY/NR730/2016 (NR730; Gen-Bank Acc. no. MH899939) was isolated from an ND vaccinated layer flock in Egypt suffering from respiratory distress. The virus was characterized as velogenic having an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 1.8 and belonged to genotype 2.VII.1.1 (formerly 2.VIIb) [37] . Pigeon type paramyxovirus-1 (pigeon/Germany/ R75/1998), genotype 2.VI, was derived from the repository of the ND reference laboratory at the FLI (Acc. No. KJ736742) and NDV/clone 30, genotype 2.II, was derived from a commercial vaccine (MSD, New Jersey, USA). As a source of polyclonal reference antibodies, watery egg yolk preparation from eggs from specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens was used, immunized repeatedly with specified inactivated NDV antigens. A monospecific rabbit α-NDV-HN serum and α-NDV-F serum [38] were used for specific detection of NDV-HN protein by western blot (WB) analysis. Immunizations were carried out in accordance with the legally approved protocol (MV-LALLF-7221.3-2.5-010/10).Virus was propagated in embryonated SPF chicken eggs (ECE) as described [39] (VALO BioMedia GmbH, Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany). Amino-allantoic fluid (AAF) was harvested on day 3 post infection (dpi) and purified by sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation. Briefly, debris was cleared from AAF by low speed centrifugation (30 min at 10,976 × g; 10,000 rpm Rotor JA-10; Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). Then virus was spun down by ultra-centrifugation (1.5 h at 96,281 × g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor, Beckman Coulter). Virus pellets from 6 tubes were re-suspended in a total of 45 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 1 M KCl (KCl-PBS) before adding 15 mL of the virus suspension on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30-60%, in KCl-PBS). Visible bands forming after ultra-centrifugation overnight (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter) were collected and diluted 1:5 in KCl-PBS before pelleting the virus by ultra-centrifugation for 1.5 h (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter).

36,How were animal models used to study pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses in different species?,"[' a Phase I clinical trial in humans [170] . Despite being highly restricted in replication, the vaccine virus was immunogenic in all subjects in at least one assay (HAI or neutralization assay). Again, the degree of restriction of replication of the vaccine virus in humans was not predicted by studies in mice.The emergence of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus prompted a rapid response from the research community and vaccine manufacturers to develop a vaccine against the emerging virus. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, based on the A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, were produced using the same manufacturing process and regulatory infrastructure as for seasonal influenza vaccines in order to make vaccine available expeditiously. The pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccines were evaluated in limited clinical trials to support licensure but extensive pre-clinical testing in animals was not performed. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines for the novel H1N1 influenza virus were licensed in September 2009 in the US. Animal models, however, will be needed for the continued study of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus and for the evaluation of alternative approaches to develop vaccines against this pathogen. Several laboratories have reported studies of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus isolates in laboratory animals. These studies are summarized in the following section.Pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses isolated from humans replicated efficiently in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice without prior adaptation [171, 172] . However, differences in the severity of disease caused by the A/California/04/ 2009 (H1N1) isolate were reported by the two laboratories. Maines et al. reported that the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) isolate was highly infectious in the mouse model, with a 50% mouse infectious dose (MID 50 ) of between 10 0.5 and 10 1.5 plaque forming units (PFU), but this virus and two other isolates (A/Texas/15/2009 and A/Mexico/4108/2009) were not lethal in mice; whereas Itoh and co-workers reported that the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus was lethal in mice at an LD 50 of 10 5.8 PFU, and that mortality was also observed in mice infected with another isolate, WSLH34939 (LD 50 of 10 4.5 PFU). In both studies, weight loss was observed in mice following infection with A/California/04/2009, but the disease was far more severe in the study conducted by Itoh et al. In both studies, the peak virus titer in the lungs at day 3 post-infection was similar (between 10 5.8 and 10 7.8 PFU), and virus replication was restricted to the respiratory tract. Higher levels of virus replication and more severe pathological changes were observed in the lungs of mice infected with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus compared to those inoculated with a recent seasonal human H1N1 influenza virus.

Mice that were inoculated with the seasonal H1N1 virus had progressed to bronchitis and peribronchitis by day 6 p.i., but there was much less extensive staining for virus antigen in the tissues from these animals.An inactivated split-virion vaccine for pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza, administered with or without adjuvant (MF59), was evaluated in mice [173] . These studies suggested that a single dose of vaccine required an adjuvant to elicit a serum HAI response that was predictive of protection. Interim data from human clinical studies demonstrated that a single dose of 7.5 mg of HA, administered with MF59, did indeed elicit serum antibody responses that were predictive of protection, according to the criteria for the licensure of seasonal influenza vaccines [174] . However, data from recipients of the same vaccine administered without adjuvant were not reported [174] . Interim data from clinical trials of an inactivated pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine suggest that, surprisingly, a single dose of unadjuvanted vaccine is sufficiently immunogenic to meet the criteria established for the licensure of seasonal influenza vaccines [175] .

Forty per cent of NHS doctors 5 reported psychological and emotional conditions before the pandemic [3] , with GPs in particular experiencing high 6 levels of burnout [4, 5] . 7 8 COVID-19 brought about many adaptations to general practice, including a rapid transition to e-consultations, 9 creation of 'hot' and 'cold' clinics (those examining patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and those addressing 10 unrelated needs), managing the manifestations of the pandemic in their practice, managing risk, and responding to 11 rapidly evolving guidelines. Indeed, high levels of stress and burnout amongst GPs during the COVID19 pandemic 12 have been reported internationally, with an expanding literature on this topic (e.g. [6] [7] [8] . Two UK studies of GP 13 pandemic experiences show greater work stress due to rapid change and uncertainty [9] and the importance of 14 teams in creating a sense of solidarity [10] . These studies are relatively small - Trivedi [9] studied 111 GPs in 15Leicestershire and Wanat et al [10] is a cross-European qualitative interview study of primary care staff, but includes 16 only seven GPs in England. Research studying the pandemic experiences of a national sample of UK GPs is needed. 17 18 Social media use by health professionals has become increasingly widespread [11, 12] and this has expanded during 19 the pandemic; Twitter is one of the most common types of social media platform [13] [14] [15] . Increasing numbers of GPs 20 are using social media, and increasing frequency of posts provides a useful tool for ascertaining their personal views 21 and experiences. Doctors use Twitter to discuss, rapidly and informally, current issues pertinent to their work and to 22 communicate with colleagues [13] . Unsurprisingly, this has focused recently on issues related to COVID-19 and work 23 practices [16] . Analysis of Twitter posts is used commonly to identify public experiences and opinions, including 24 recently on COVID-19 and its impact [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .Medical professionals' opinions about COVID-19 have been studied 25 using social media [32] , but no studies to date have examined GP wellbeing using social media monitoring, which is 26 the aim of this study. 27 28 Methods 29 30 Firstly, we sought to explore trends pre-and post-COVID using a longitudinal analysis of GPs' tweet content (January 31 2019 to February 2021). Secondly, a more qualitative analysis explored themes emerging from GP tweets during the 32 pandemic (February 2020 to February 2021) with a particular focus on GP wellbeing.

38,"What are the benefits of using vision-based approach in fault diagnosis, based on participants' feedback?","["" as component-related material and reordering metadata. The participants also recognized that the visual fault explanations could mainly help them localize faults significantly faster as well as develop a thorough comprehension and understanding of the fault. Specifically, it was mentioned that the easier localization could reduce the workload and accelerate the root cause analysis. On the downside, it could hinder independent examination of the images in the long run. The image augmentations consequently provide fault interpretability (DP4). Most significantly, all participants acknowledged that the IB-DSS is especially suitable for improved maintenance decisionmaking, as they would be able to ''work more efficiently, simply work more or even combine activities'' (Epsilon). In fact, besides the planning and scoping of individual Fig. 7 Structure of our user interface with its different views and the transitions between the views maintenance orders, the improved data and information availability and quality enhance four key decision-making tasks: finding and discovering systematic faults (Epsilon, Iota, Lambda), combining maintenance orders (Eta, Epsilon, Kappa), discussing maintenance budget (My, Iota, Ny), and scoping and planning long-term restoration projects (My, Kappa).In this section we depict the contributions and limitations of our work and present an outlook regarding PLC inspection and maintenance.Our results imply that our instantiated IB-DSS enables maintenance engineers to make better, more informed decisions about repairing or replacing PLCs by means of improved data and information quality.More generally, this suggests that the rich information from uniformly acquired images extracted through deeplearning-based image processing capabilities combined with contextual information of metadata and interpretability provided by visual data exploration is a valuable solution to the information intensive context of maintenance and monitoring applications. Figure 8 depicts the schematic layout of these aspects. Consequently, we hypothesize that our derived knowledge provides a nascent design theory for the still underresearched class of IB-DSS. This design knowledge might be particularly valuable for creating automated decision support systems in information-intensive contexts where decision-makers largely rely on unstructured vision-based image data. This in turn would increase the quality of decision both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness (Kraus et al. 2020) .The schematic layout of our conceptualized design principles, as depicted in Fig. 8 , therefore provides prescriptive knowledge that may serve as a blueprint (Gregor and Jones 2007) to develop similar systems for visionbased applications.In our specific use case of PLC inspection, the proposed IB-DSS relying on UAV generated images can provide multiple benefits compared with the status quo. It can prevent accidents since hazardous inspection methods like tower-climbing are no longer necessary -as the inspection of the towers is now performed by unmanned UAVs. While no coherent numbers are available within Europe, recent reports from the US demonstrate that power line work is listed among top 10 most dangerous jobs. Each year, over 40 power line workers receive fatal injuries resulting from falling or electrocution (Schwarz and Drudi 2018) . While certainly only a share of these workers die during inspection activities (rather than the repair activity itself), it is desirable to save every life possible. The non-fatal injuries amount to 1200 per year in the US (Schwarz and Drudi 2018) and the typical reasons are falling, slipping and tripping. We also expect significant reduction of injuries in this area, once automation of inspection is implemented.Currently, the data that MEs work with are tables of compiled inspection reports with heterogeneous assessments of a distributed workforce. The standardized data acquisition and processing results in (1) more reliable and (2) more structured data. Combined with the benefits of a unified interface that provides metadata and latent, information maintenance decisions are fully comprehensible.In total, the participants of the confirmatory workshop affirmed that the IB-DSS enhances their decision-making substantially. As mentioned by Epsilon, Theta, Kappa, and My, besides the pure planning of maintenance orders the artifact could moreover be utilized for other tasks, like the combination of maintenance orders or the planning of longterm restoration projects. While meeting Gregor and Jones 's (2007) six common criteria for design theories, our design knowledge for IB-DSS carries limitations that open opportunities for future research. Our research can only be generalized to a limited extent because it was conducted at one company in the power line infrastructure domain and focused on a selection of defect cases. While we can claim some generalization by supporting our design through kernel theories and other studies, further IB-DSS should be developed for other use cases and in other domains to extend and consolidate the design theory. Furthermore, our research lacks quantification of the effect on the field efficiency of the image processing. Quantitative studies in this regard could be conducted to benchmark the artifact's effects in terms of performance of automated versus manual image processing.Within our presented research, we showed novel ways to design condition-based maintenance systems. More precisely, we utilized images captured by UAVs which were subsequently automatically analyzed and included within"", "" and diagnose PLCs was introduced. Exemplary images (cf. Fig. 3, page 21) were shown to clarify the use case. The interviewees were allowed to ask questions of comprehension. Subsequently, in a semi-structured interview fashion each participant was asked to evaluate the DFs. A detailed overview of the questionnaire can be found in Appendix A3 on page 40. The question of whether each presented DF appropriately addresses its respective DPs served as the starting point. The interviewees opinion and attitude regarding all DFs was explored and probing questions were asked if necessary. This allowed us to assess the attitude of human expert workers towards the technology. This initial evaluation of part of the IB-DSS's tentative design serve as initial mediation to ensure that the final artifact can be designed as a useful and efficient instrument for solving our research question.In accordance with Hevner and Chatterjee 's (2010) suggestion for the analysis of confirmatory focus groups and King 's (1998) general proposal of template analysis for textual data, we adapted the approach for the analysis of the interview transcripts. The artifact's DPs served as the initial coding categories.In general, the interviewees confirmed the usefulness of the way the image acquisition (DP1) is performed and also acknowledged the image processing (DP2) to extract comparable, trustful, and helpful information. They specifically confirmed the usefulness of the vision-based approach for capturing a wide variety of different faults. More significantly, the ability to ''[...] look into the detailed pictures is already of high value'' (Iota) since it is easier to scope maintenance operations from component images rather than plain table entries. Additionally, the interviewees emphasized the good quality of the images as well as the improved perspective to view the PLCs and respective defects, due to the UAVs being able to fly close to the component of interest. Similarly, the functionality to automatically analyze the images for components and their faults was perceived as a major gain and precisely addressed the request of interviewee Zeta: ''It would actually be quite interesting if someone or something evaluates these pictures that the drone captures and then just sends the damage.'' The interviewees stressed several particular factors. First and foremost, the prevention of subjectivity was mentioned, leading to a uniformity in fault diagnosis and consequently to a flawless comparability between faults. Second, besides the presented ability to detect insulators, fittings, birdnests and safetypins, the interviewees assumed that several other components could be added easily. However, in more detail two participants raised doubts about the system's ability to recognize severe incidents such as completely broken and consequently dangling insulators. Finally, six out of the nine participants indicated, without being asked, that they felt there were benefits in using an automated process to extract defective components. They specifically mentioned benefits regarding timeliness, cost, and performance in comparison to the current manual inspection methods. However, although the proposed extraction of faults generated generally positive feedback, the need to ''comprehend: how did this assessment come about'' (Ny) was mentioned. Consequently, both the results and the reasoning of the fault diagnosis require visualization. Supporting MEs based on improved data and information quality requires making them accessible through a UIC. In the following, we describe the UICs' design and evaluation.To create a UIC that accomplishes the preliminary DRs of visualization (DR5) of the network and related defects (Shakhatreh et al. 2019) , we implemented the artifact based on the inferred DPs (cf. Fig. 2 on page 15) using Tableau 6 and Javascript. The artifact integrates two data sources: (1) UAV-captured image data (DP1) and its according metadata (DP3) as well as (2) metadata about the physical objects of the power line infrastructure (DP3) at our case company, such as geographical position or age. Information that is extracted as part of the image processing (cf. Sect. 5.2) is integrated into the artifact (DP2 and DP4). Finally, these building blocks are arranged in a meaningful way to support decision-making through visual data exploration (DP5). Figure 7 depicts the different views and their interactive links along with the respective DFs.To satisfy DP5, the general layout of the UIC should follow the visual exploration paradigm (Shneiderman 1996) and provide overview first, allow for zoom and filter capabilities, and then accommodate details on demand. We base our UIC on four different views which emphasize different task properties in our multidimensional data and maximize the availability of explicit and latent information. View (1) provides an operational dashboard view (DF7) to get a quick and aggregated sense of the condition of the power line infrastructure. View (2) contains a geographical information system view (DF5) to find and inspect adjacent infrastructure items and faults. This allows MEs to explore both the incident location to determine maintenance order specifics as well as further incidents which can be bundled""]","The benefits of using a vision-based approach in fault diagnosis, based on participants' feedback, include: prevention of subjectivity leading to uniformity in fault diagnosis, improved perspective to view PLCs and defects, ability to detect a wide variety of different faults, timeliness, cost-effectiveness, and improved performance compared to manual inspection methods.",reasoning,True
39,"""What were the respiratory tract changes in infected ferrets and primates, and how did severity differ between seasonal and pandemic H1N1 viruses?""","[' Beyond a mild level of inactivity, overt clinical signs of influenza were not observed in ferrets inoculated with A/California/04/2009 [171, 172] . More pronounced clinical features, some resulting in euthanasia, were observed in ferrets inoculated with virus isolates from Texas and Mexico [172] , but not in animals that received pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus isolates from Wisconsin, the Netherlands and Japan [171] . The clinical symptoms seen in ferrets did not reflect the severity of infection in the patients from whom the viruses were isolated.In general, the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses and recent seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses replicated efficiently and to similar levels in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, but the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses achieved higher titers in the lungs [171, 172, 176] . The virus was also detected in rectal swabs and tissue samples taken from the intestinal tract of infected ferrets [172] . There have been sporadic reports of gastrointestinal symptoms in human cases of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza infection [177] , but this does not appear to be common, and the significance of this observation, with respect to pathogenesis of infection with these viruses, is not clear.Pathologic changes were observed in the respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated with either seasonal or pandemic H1N1 viruses, but the changes were more extensive and more severe in ferrets infected with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses. Itoh et al. reported similar levels of viral antigen in the nasal mucosa of animals that received either seasonal or pandemic virus. The lungs of ferrets inoculated with the seasonal H1N1 virus A appeared mostly normal, whereas A/California/04/2009-infected ferrets had more severe bronchopneumonia with prominent expression of viral antigen in the peribronchial glands and in a few alveolar cells. Similarly, ferrets inoculated with a pandemic H1N1 isolate from the Netherlands had mild to moderate, multi-focal, necrotizing rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis on day 3 p.i. with viral antigen observed in many cells in the nasal cavity, trachea, bronchus, and bronchioles while the pathologic changes and the presence of viral antigen were limited to the upper respiratory tract and were less extensive, respectively, in ferrets inoculated with seasonal H1N1 influenza [176] . By day 7 p.i., most of the virus-infected cells had been cleared from the respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated with either the seasonal or pandemic H1N1 virus. The pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses were also found to efficiently transmit via direct contact and respiratory droplets. In summary, the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses replicated more efficiently than seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses in the lower respiratory tract of ferrets. This increased level of replication was associated with more severe pathologic changes in the lower respiratory tract, but did not generally result in more severe clinical illness.As described above, there have been several reports of the use of non-human primate species as models for studies of influenza infection and for the evaluation of experimental influenza vaccines. To date, there is only one report of infection of non-human primates with pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses. Itoh and colleagues studied the infection of cynomolgus macaques with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus [171] . As with the previous studies of avian H5N1 influenza viruses in this model, multiple routes of inoculation were used to establish infection: animals were inoculated with a total dose of 10 7.4 PFU via the intratracheal, intranasal, ocular and oral routes. Macaques inoculated with the A/California/04/ 2009 (H1N1) virus experienced a greater increase in body temperature than animals that received a recent seasonal H1N1 virus, but they exhibited no other clinical signs of infection. The pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus replicated more efficiently in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of macaques, achieving titers of between 10 4.3 and 10 6.9 PFU in the lungs on day 3 p.i. High titers of virus (>10 5 PFU) were still detected in the oro/nasopharynx, tonsil and bronchi of one animal on day 7 p.i., but it had been cleared from the other respiratory tissues.Pathologic changes were observed in animals inoculated with either pandemic or seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses, but these lesions were more severe in the animals that received the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus.

40,Which company conducted the first COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial and what is the name and trial number of their mRNA-based vaccine?,"['Fruitful Neutralizing Antibody Pipeline Brings Hope To Defeat SARS-Cov-2\nThe interaction between the RBD and ACE2 is the first event in cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, and is thus an attractive prospect for the development of therapeutics against COVID-19, both for treating infected patients and for preventing infection [16, 17] . Targeting the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to inhibit its binding to ACE2 can potentially be achieved with limited side effects on surrounding host cells [18] .Cambridge-based Moderna Inc. was the first to launch a vaccine clinical trial, initiating Phase I of their mRNA-based vaccine trial only 67 days (mRNA-1273, Clinical Trial Number i NCT04283461, 16 March 2020) after inception of the program. Promising data from their Phase I trial were recently published in which vaccination induced strong virus-neutralizing activity [19] . The Chinese company CanSino also announced their Phase I study of an adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector carrying the SARS-CoV-2 S protein gene (Ad5-nCoV, NCT04341389) on 16 March 2020, and has since reported significant humoral and specific T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 in their Phase I [20] and II studies [21] . A host of other agents have since emerged, ranging from additional viral vector-and nucleic acid-based designs to protein-based S protein subunit vaccines, as well as the traditional inactivated/attenuated viruses [22] [23] [24] ii .On the therapeutics side, small molecules are receiving significant attention, and N300 candidates are in development, primarily based around the strategy of drug repurposing. Repurposing of remdesivir [25] (initially trialed against Ebola virus, MERS coronavirus, and other RNA viruses [26, 27] ) has recently shown some promising data in a Phase III trial [28] in patients with moderate COVID-19. In another clinical trial (NCT04381936), researchers from the University of Oxford have also reported success with another repurposed drug, dexamethasone (primarily used as a general anti-inflammatory medicine) in reducing the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients [28] . Another treatment option that has shown some promise is convalescent plasma transfer [29] [30] [31] [32] . Despite US FDA approval and widespread use as a therapeutic, a recent report [33] conflicts with earlier studies on the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy, suggesting that this strategy may not confer significant clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients.Although the above highlights a multitude of different paths towards COVID-19 treatments, one class of therapeutics that has not yet shown success are neutralizing antibodies and their functional fragments [18, 34] . We discuss these neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 and highlight how the robust antibody pipeline can help to combat the escape strategies presented by SARS-CoV-2.Genomic identity between the S protein coding sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is 76% [5, 35] . In addition, structural comparisons of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 illustrate a high degree of similarity in overall conformation [9] . Thus, antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 serve as an initial pool of candidates with potentially neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 [36, 37] . In Wrapp et al., the landmark paper highlighting the first solved structure of the prefusion spike of SARS-CoV-2, initial testing of previously established antibodies S230, m396, and 80R against SARS-CoV-1 RBD was conducted, but failed to show any level of binding to SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations as high as 1 μM [16] . In another study, T62, a preparation of polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-1 S1 antibodies, showed potent neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-1, but only limited neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions [38] .Other antibodies such as VHH-72 and S309 (both originally developed for SARS-CoV-1) have shown significant neutralization activity against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Glossary Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2): the target receptor of SARS-CoV-1/2 which is mainly expressed in human vascular endothelial cells and the renal tubular epithelium.

41,"Which optimizer was used for training the models in the fault diagnosis of the safetypins, and what were the initial learning rates for the stochastic gradient descent optimizer for the Faster R-CNN and SSD models?","["" the fault diagnosis of the safetypins. To compare and benchmark the fault diagnosis, we chose the well-known VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) architecture. In both tasks, image augmentation was used to improve the generalization of the models. For object detection the brightness of the images was randomly adjusted. For the classification task, where cropped images of safetypins were classified, we applied horizontal and vertical flipping, random brightness adjustment, width as well as height range shifting, and random image blurring.The component detectors were implemented using the Tensorflow 3 DL framework 4 (Abadi et al. 2015) with models pretrained on the MS COCO dataset (Lin et al. 2014) . The image classifiers were realized using the Keras DL library 5 (Chollet et al. 2015) which provides image classification models pretrained on the ILSVRC dataset (Russakovsky et al. 2015) .For the evaluation of DF1-DF3 and DP1 and DP2 respectively, we conducted both an artificial evaluation to closely assess the pipeline's efficacy and efficiency as well as a naturalistic evaluation to generally judge the design's acceptance and usefulness. In accordance, the evaluation episodes were guided by the questions below: Artificial evaluation of the model component (EE I.I) The efficiency evaluation of the proposed pipelines required two considerations. First, the pipeline's ability to detect the chosen components needed to be evaluated. Second, the accuracy of the fault diagnosis -which we performed for detected safetypins -had to be assessed.Evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the detection task in terms of average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP) (Rafael Padilla and da Silva 2020), we compared our proposed MSCD to the SSCD pipeline. As we were working with our own proprietary dataset DS Ro , the available images were split into a training set comprising 80% of the data, with the remaining 20% used for the evaluation set. To increase the evaluation's validity, images captured at one tower were held out from the random split and solely utilized for the evaluation dataset, while maintaining the split ratio. This image-level split was kept consistent across the derived datasets DS1 Co and DS2 Fi . The SSCD pipeline was fine-tuned to detect the respective component classes using the DS Ro dataset. Accordingly, both detection stages of the MSCD pipeline were fine-tuned on DS1 Co and DS2 Fi respectively. All models were trained using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer with 0.0003 (Faster R-CNN) and 0.001 (SSD) initial learning rate respectively, 0.9 momentum, and batch size 64. We determined the models by using early stopping on the validation loss with a patience of 100 for all models. The testing results of the different pipelines using the different architectures are shown in Fig. 6 . The performance for the safetypin class is disclosed in terms of inter pipeline performance for both the SSCD and the MSCD pipeline as well as the intra pipeline performance for solely the MSCD pipeline.We evaluated the fault diagnosis task performed for the safetypins class in terms of weighted precision, weighted recall, and weighted F 1 -score (Pedregosa et al. 2011) to account for class imbalance. We applied a 3-fold cross validated grid-search to identify the optimal combination of parameters. We chose to account for the following parameter: unfrozen convolutional layers, dense layer size, optimizer and its respective learning rate, dropout rate, and batch size. The images in dataset DS3 Pi were shuffled, a hold out set containing 10% of the images was retained and the remaining images were split into 3 folds. Consequently, for each grid search configuration three models were trained with early stopping with patience 30. The best resulting model of the Resnet and VGG16 model were harnessed to be evaluated on the retained hold out set. The results of the evaluation of the cropped safetypin classification task based on the test set are shown in Table 6 . All details on the machine learning steps and choices are depicted within Sect.

Monkeys were infected by multiple routes -intratracheally, orally, on the tonsils and conjunctiva -based on the earlier studies with HPAI H5N1 influenza viruses in this species [162] . Animals infected with the reconstructed 1918 virus had severe clinical illness, high levels of virus replication in the respiratory tract and severe pathological changes in the lungs compared to control animals infected with a recombinant human H1N1 influenza virus, A/Kawasaki/173/01 [167] .There may be a place for non-human primates as models for the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines, but the currently available data are not sufficient to support the use of these animals for immunogenicity or efficacy studies. Further studies are needed to characterize AI infection and the immune responses to AI viruses and vaccines in these species.The development of live attenuated vaccines against influenza viruses with pandemic potential has rapidly progressed from pre-clinical evaluation to early stage clinical testing in recent years. Data from both mouse and ferret models suggested that vaccine viruses of H5, H6, H7, and H9 subtypes, though restricted in replication in the respiratory tract compared to wild-type viruses, elicited serum antibody responses and were protective against both lethal challenge and pulmonary and extra-pulmonary replication following wild-type virus challenge. In addition, crossprotection against heterologous wild-type viruses was observed to varying degrees. Studies in non-human primates also showed that live attenuated H5 influenza virus vaccines could replicate in the respiratory tract and elicit serum HAI responses [113, 165] .In clinical trials involving small numbers of healthy adults, live attenuated coldadapted H5N1 vaccine candidates, based on the clade 1 viruses A/Vietnam/1203/ 2004 and A/Hong Kong/213/2003, were found to be highly restricted in replication and poorly immunogenic [168] . A live vaccine virus, based on the A/Vietnam/ 1203/04 (H5N1) virus, when administered in two doses at 10 7.5 TCID 50 per dose, failed to elicit neutralizing antibody in the serum of vaccinees and elicited serum HAI antibody in only 10% of the study subjects. Serum IgA and nasal wash IgA responses were detected in 52% and 19% of subjects, respectively; serum or local IgA responses had not been measured in ferret studies. Although the underlying reasons have not yet been elucidated, the poor predictive value of the mouse and ferret models with respect to replication and immunogenicity of these particular vaccine candidates was unexpected.Rudenko et al. reported that a live attenuated cold-adapted vaccine, with the HA from a low pathogenicity avian H5N2 virus, elicited serum HAI and neutralizing antibodies in about 50% of volunteers after two doses, and resulted in the production of local IgA in the respiratory tract in 65% of vaccinees [166] . The level of shedding of the vaccine virus in volunteers was not determined. The reasons for the superior immunogenicity of the H5N2 ca vaccine virus, compared to the H5N1 vaccines based on the A/AA/6/60 ca in these small clinical studies, are not fully understood. It is possible that the donor cold-adapted H2N2 virus used to generate the H5N2 ca vaccine virus is less attenuated than the A/AA/6/60 ca donor virus, resulting in a vaccine virus that replicates more efficiently, however, this cannot be confirmed since replication of the H5N2 ca vaccine virus in humans was not reported. Given the poor predictive value of the mouse and ferret models with respect to the replication and immunogenicity of clade 1 live attenuated H5N1 vaccines in humans [66, 168] , it will be interesting to see how the A/Anhui/2/2005 cold-adapted vaccine described by Fan et al. [113] behaves in human clinical trials.The H7N3 ca vaccine virus was highly restricted in replication in Phase I clinical studies but elicited an immune response in over 90% of subjects [169] . However, serum IgA, and not HAI or neutralizing antibody, was the most frequently observed indication of immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans, with a serum IgA response being detected in 71% of subjects, and 62% and 48% of the subjects developing a fourfold or greater rise in HAI or neutralizing antibody, respectively. Studies in mice and ferrets did not accurately predict such restricted replication of the vaccine virus and it is difficult to determine the predictive value of the mouse and ferret studies in terms of immunogenicity, since the number of human subjects in whom the vaccine was evaluated was small, and serum IgA responses were not studied in animals.An H9N2 ca vaccine was evaluated in']","Animals infected with the reconstructed 1918 virus had severe clinical illness, high levels of virus replication in the respiratory tract and severe pathological changes in the lungs compared to control animals infected with a recombinant human H1N1 influenza virus, A/Kawasaki/173/01.",reasoning,True

Whether background immunosuppressive medications put individuals with rheumatic disease at an increased or decreased risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown, and evidence is lacking to guide treatment decisions. 105 This population may, however, represent an interesting group to study as some disease-modifying drugs commonly used to treat rheumatic diseases, such as hydroxychloroquine, or biologics targeting interleukin IL-6 (as tocilizumab) 51 52 106 107 or sarilumab, 108 IL-1 (as anakinra) 56 or JAKi are being or have been assessed in patients with severe COVID-19.It should be added that in times of broad vaccination against COVID-19 in Western countries, one study demonstrated that the overall response rate to COVID-19 vaccine in patients suffering from systemic rheumatic diseases treated with JAKi remained high, 109 in line with rates reported with other immunosuppressants. 110 In this review, we will develop on the use of JAKi for the treatment of severe form of COVID-19.Baricitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, was suggested as soon as February 2020 as a potential treatment for COVID-19 acute respiratory disease 111 using BenevolentAI's knowledge graph. BenevolentAI is a large repository of structured medical information that include different and numerous connections extracted by machine learning. Adaptation/customization to COVID-19 was applied to this resource and approved drugs that may inhibit the viral infection were searched. Baricitinib was identified as a potential molecule that could inhibit infection of lung cells by SARS-CoV-2. One of the key cell subtypes expressing the ACE2 receptor are lung AT2 alveolar cells. Viruses enter by endocytosis and many small molecule kinase inhibitors were shown to prevent entry into cells of different virus types. 112 113 One regulator of endocytosis is AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), which belongs to the group of Numb-Associated Kinases. A prediction was formulated that inhibition of AAK1 could prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry and then also intracellular virion assembly. One of the molecules predicted to inhibit AAK1 was baricitinib which also binds to another endocytosis regulator, cyclin G-associated kinase. The prediction was that baricitinib would inhibit both virus entry (via AAK1 targeting) and inflammation by targeting JAK1 and JAK2 downstream many cytokine receptors during cytokine storm. 111 This work was extended and the affinity and selectivity of the identified drugs were examined in order to point to anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs. Baricitinib, fedratinib and ruxolitinib were highlighted as having similar JAK-STAT inhibitory potency, baricitinib stood out due to its AAK1 inhibition capacity. In a EMEA trial with baricitinib for autoimmune diseases in 4214 patients, a small increase in upper respiratory infection has been seen, but the incidence of severe infections was similar to placebo. 114 That baricitinib holds the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection was also reviewed in reference 115. Experimental evidence showed that indeed baricitinib exerts an antiviral effect separated from its antiinflammatory effects. 116 117 In a case series of patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, baricitinib treatment was associated with clinical and radiologic recovery, a rapid decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, inflammatory markers and IL6 levels. Collectively, these data supported further evaluation of the anti-cytokine and anti-viral activity of baricitinib and suggested its assessment in randomized trials in hospitalized COVID-""]",The effects of ruxolitinib on the immune system in corticotherapy-resistant GVHd are not identical to those of corticotherapy.,reasoning,True
44,What is the impact of the C5a-C5aR axis on lung cancer cells and the role of the PI3K/AKT axis?,"[' et al. reported that blockade of the C5a-C5aR1 axis resulted in a substantial improvement in the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies against lung cancer growth and metastasis through CXCL16-mediated effects. 29 We demonstrated high expression of CCL2 but no difference in CCL7 or CX3CL1 expression in MPE compared with transudate plural effusion (Figure 3 Compared with other monocyte subsets, intermediate monocytes in humans express higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, 30, 31 which promotes the progression of tumors. 32 However, the role of cytokines released by intermediate monocytes in MPE needs to be further elucidated. Our data showed a significant increase in IL-1β expression in MPE supernatant and a higher level of IL-1β secretion in intermediate monocytes isolated from MPE (Figure 4(a),(b) ). Consistent with a previous in vitro study in neutrophils, 33 our data showed that C5a has the potential to induce the generation of LPS-stimulated IL-1β in intermediate monocytes (Figure 4(c) , (d)). Collectively, our results demonstrated that the C5a-C5aR axis not only regulates the infiltration of intermediate monocytes into the pleural cavity, but also increases the proportion of IL-1β-releasing intermediate monocytes, which participate in the immune response in MPE.Although C5a has been reported to be an essential mediator of inflammation-induced tumorigenesis, little information is known about its role in the progression of tumor cells. 17 We found that C5a induced A549 cell proliferation in lung cancer, which was consistent with the findings of Chen et al. 20 Chen et al. also proved that the C5a-C5aR pathway participates in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer via activation of the PI3K/AKT axis. 19 Similarly, our results showed that C5a treatment led to a highly significant increase in the levels of p-AKT. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor LY29f4002 was reported to inhibit A549 proliferation in the presence of C5a ( Figure 5(d) ,(e)). Thus, it is plausible to suggest that C5a-C5aR signaling regulates the proliferation of lung carcinoma cells via PI3K/AKT axis activation. Some reports have indicated that the C5a-C5aR axis decreases apoptosis in several cell types, such as neutrophils, 34 T cells, 35 and macrophages. 36 Our current study suggested that the C5a-C5aR axis could protect lung cancer cells from DDP-induced apoptosis ( Figure 5 (h),(i)). The migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of tumor cells are also important factors influencing tumor metastasis. Our data revealed that C5a facilitated the migration and invasion of lung carcinoma cells ( Figure 5 (j),(k)). Additionally, C5a was reported to promote the intercellular adhesion of A549 cells to PMCs ( Figure 5 (l),(m)), consistent with previous studies, which proved that C5a was the principal initiator of neutrophil adhesion by regulating cell adhesion molecules. 37 Furthermore, the C5a axis showed a similar role in promoting EMT in A549 cells ( Figure 5 (n)) as it did in renal tubular epithelial cells. 38 Overall, our study revealed that C5a exerted a tumor-promoting effect by inducing the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of A549 cells and inhibiting the apoptosis of tumor cells, while C5aRA significantly reversed these effects.IL-1β has emerged as a key component of tumorpromoting inflammation by shaping different elements of the tumor microenvironment, including cancer cell proliferation, 32,39 migration, and metastasis. 32, 40 Based on our data showing that C5a has the ability to induce IL-1β secretion from intermediate monocytes, we attempted to explore the role of IL-1β overexpression stimulated by C5a. Here, we demonstrated that the IL-1β/IL-1R axis could promote the proliferation of A549 cells in vitro (Figure 6(a) , (b)), which was consistent with previous studies on human natural killer cells and glioblastoma cells. 41 We also found a tendency towards the upregulation of MAPK/p-MAPK expression in A549 cells after IL-1β treatment (Figure 6(c) ), but further study is needed to confirm whether the MAPK signaling pathway is the main mechanism by which IL-1β induces the growth of tumor cells. According to previous studies, the IL-1β/IL-1R axis is also a regulator of apoptosis in several cell types. 42 Our study reached a similar']","The C5a-C5aR axis regulates the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of lung cancer cells and inhibits apoptosis.

45,How did housing groups and coalitions in Lisbon bring attention to urban poor struggles?,"[' housing and to the city and is at the forefront of the national political debate in Lisbon, while focusing also on drawing the attention of civil society to housing-related issues (Mendes 2020) . The open letter turned out to be a strong point of connection among activists around the housing problem, leading to the formation of groups that had already existed to a certain extent but were too dispersed. Together, the groups and individuals that signed the letter created a new way to communicate with the public, as MEL is focused on organizational flexibility, public discussion and horizontality of representation. Commenting on the expansion of the group, one of MEL\'s first signatories said ""MEL was gaining space in public opinion because it has great media impact. We work a lot also through Facebook, online, so after a while we started to gain some representation with politicians"" (Participant 39). The group grew to be an important forum for dialogues with various political and institutional actors responsible for housing in the city, being invited for parliamentary hearings and to media appearances. MEL is coordinated by a committee of neighborhood associations and strongly supported by academics.The emergence and participation of so many housing groups suggests a keen interest in a sustained housing movement in Ireland, even if the housing activists have not yet been able to create an inclusive and sustained housing movement. The complex and diverse housing groups and coalitions that emerged in Lisbon in response to housing financialization and gentrification have been able to highlight the struggles of the urban poor. But how do members of MEL and RTR navigate in this complex, multi-actor, inter-organizational space to cooperate and sustain their coalitions? I examine these questions next.RTR involves experienced and resourceful activists, such as trade union members and political parties, who have aided the coalition in reaching the wider public. After a successful conference organized by the ICTU, the diverse groups in attendance agreed on the financial and unfair aspects of the housing crisis and observed that some smaller actions were taking place at local level. The logical conclusion then was to connect those groups around the same platform, as explained by this member of the RTR coalition, a representative of a trade union:""We had a whole range of smaller campaigns who had been essentially saying more or less the same thing over a longer period of time, not necessarily connecting up. So, on foot of that meeting we agreed we should work together as best as possible and try to create a broader civil society platform"" (Participant 14).Morar em Lisboa (MEL) started off as a small collective of six people publishing an open letter in the Trienal de Arquitectura de Lisboa (Lisbon Architecture Triennale). Put together by academics, housing activists and other entities, MEL quickly expanded to connect people and groups against gentrification and for the right to housing and the city. The founders intended to connect the various groups engaged in similar activities and focused on denouncing the fast-paced gentrification Lisbon was going through and its impact on local residents. As reported by an activist who was one of the first signatories of the open letter:We wanted a movement where we could denounce what is happening in this city. The issue of gentrification, a question that nobody was talking about at the time. The question of people being evicted when the rental contracts ended. It is a movement of denunciation and pressure and there were a lot of people thinking just that, so we brought them together (Participant 38).Both the RTR and MEL coalitions intended to make the best use of their capacity to attract a variety of organizations and individual participants to secure the widest possible support for the goals of the coalition. When it comes to coalition formation, timing was also an important factor. While the political threat of the worsening housing crisis is likely to have acted as a powerful connection among actors and spurred cooperation among them, another two specific political opportunities contributed to the emergence of these coalitions in that specific time and context: the prospect of new legislation in Ireland and the approaching local elections in Portugal.RTR organized a protest rally on October 3, 2018, to coincide with a vote on a multi-party motion in the Oireachtas (National Parliament) calling on the government to declare a housing emergency, a referendum on the right to housing, the building of more social housing and the provision of rent controls, among other demands. 2 Considering that groups join coalitions when they see their efforts on a particular set of issues as urgent and potentially efficacious (Heaney and Rojas 2014; Meyer and Corrigall-Brown 2005) , the multi-party motion spurred cooperation. If successfully passed, it was a concrete outcome and an important victory for the coalition. In fact, the public pressure created by the rally, and the direct attention on the motion, was successful and the motion was passed by a majority. The proposed bill was introduced by opposition parties: Sinn Féin, the Green Party, the Labour Party, People Before Profit, Solidarity, Independents4Change, and the Social']",Housing groups and coalitions in Lisbon brought attention to urban poor struggles by highlighting the struggles of the urban poor and denouncing the fast-paced gentrification and its impact on local residents.,reasoning,True
46,Why did the health directorate of Muzzafarabad request ICRC's support for decentralizing diabetes care in Pakistan?,"['s, such as disability, stroke or amputation from diabetes should be considered (See Table 1 ). In accordance with the public health approach in humanitarian crises, some services/interventions need to be temporarily deprioritized in the initial phase of the response and integrated later on. Other interventions might not be relevant or feasible at the health facility where care is provided. For example, provision of cancer chemotherapy or dialysis for end-stage renal disease is rarely possible [19] and cannot be sustained by agencies with short-term mandates. These patients should be referred to second and third level hospitals wherever possible, as they require resource-intensive diagnostic and treatment means. Moreover, by enrolling patients into long-term programs and life-long therapies such as cancer care and renal dialysis comes financial and ethical responsibility [17] . However, supportive/palliative components of care should be provided at every stage of the response [20] .In each humanitarian emergency, selection of the NCDs to be addressed should also be based on local disease burden (see example Pakistan, Table 1 ), needs of the affected population, factors related to the context, and local and agency capacity in providing services. Chronic conditions such as epilepsy, pre-existing severe mental disorders or diseases that are highly prevalent in certain regions of the world (such as sickle cell anaemia) can be added when appropriate. Guidance on mental health exists with the ICRC\'s basic psychiatric care package to facilitate provision of care for mental health disorders along with other NCD care. For acute mental illness resulting from the humanitarian crisis, the WHO has developed the mhGAP for humanitarian interventions [21] . In a number of MSF projects, routine screening for depression is included in the care provided to NCD patients, and patients with severe mental illness are managed within the NCD cohort with clinicians trained on mhGAP ""author\'s personal knowledge"".The capacity of the health system to provide care to its population prior to the emergency significantly influences the health and recovery of the population during and following an emergency [15] . In preparing for a response, humanitarian actors need to think about the various scenarios influenced by the context (urban versus rural; conflict versus natural disaster versus public health emergency; possible duration of interventions; security constraints; competing priorities; crisis level; NCD burden and local response capacity prior to the crisis ( Fig. 1) and how this will impact prioritization.Some individuals with NCDs are more prone to critical acute exacerbations or to severe consequences with an interruption in care and need to be prioritized to reduce morbidity and mortality ( Table 2) .For example, an individual with type 1 diabetes is at great risk of serious complications and even death if unable to access insulin for just a few days [22] . Conversely, a person with type 2 diabetes who has been well-controlled on oral hypoglycemic agents is unlikely to suffer any immediate consequences if unable to obtain their oral hypoglycemic for a few weeks, even months. Therefore, in the acute phase of an emergency, a system for triage and prioritization of individuals based on the risk of complications and severity of their chronic disease should be implemented. This approach is particularly important in settings where resources are limited. Other ""risk or vulnerability factors"", such as stress, loss of family, loss of livelihood and home, being disabled, extremes of age, etc. could also be considered.The proposed considerations for the management of NCDs in humanitarian settings are centered on key components, embedded within the overarching principles of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) (i.e. people-centered, accessible, equitable, comprehensive, integrated, accountable and efficient care) [23] . These elements are built on strong ethical principles. The overall humanitarian response to NCDs requires advocacy and research to further strengthen implementation.Key components of NCD care delivery NCD management should ensure continuity of care through an integrated approach at each level of health care focusing on primary care with referral pathways to prevent excess mortality and morbidity. An integrated PHC approach will enable a more sustainable and comprehensive intervention, especially if implemented through local facilities. In absence of a functional local health structure, a reliable health partner should be identified, supported and empowered, where possible avoiding vertical programming [16, [24] [25] [26] . However, in alignment with the existing system, NCD management should be supported where it exists, as for example in Libya, where the ICRC is supporting specialised diabetes The prevalence of diabetes in Pakistan is estimated by the WHO to be 9.8% [18] . In 2016 more than 15% of lower limb amputations followedup at the physical rehabilitation center of Muzzafarabad, Pakistan were related to diabetes complications.Recognising the burden of diabetic foot problems which could be prevented, the health directorate of Muzzafarabad asked the ICRC in 2017 to support them in decentralisation of diabetes care from tertiary to the PHC level, with links to the community and referral to secondary and tertiary care as needed.']",The health directorate of Muzzafarabad requested ICRC's support for decentralizing diabetes care in Pakistan to prevent diabetic foot problems and improve diabetes care at the primary healthcare level.,reasoning,True
47,How does the user interface contribute to the design of image-based decision support systems for power line maintenance?,"[""Design Knowledge for Deep-Learning-Enabled Image-Based Decision Support Systems Evidence From Power Line Maintenance Decision-Making\ncomponent responsible for automatic fault detection of power line parts as well as a user-oriented interface responsible for presenting the captured information in a way that enables more informed decisions. As a basis for both components, preliminary design requirements are derived from literature and the application field. Drawing on justificatory knowledge from deep learning as well as decision support systems, tentative design principles are derived. Based on these design principles, a prototype of the artifact is implemented that allows for rigorous evaluation of the design knowledge in multiple evaluation episodes, covering different angles. Through a technical experiment the technical novelty of the artifact's capability to capture selected faults (regarding insulators and safety pins) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-captured image data (model component) is validated. Subsequent interviews, surveys, and workshops in a natural environment confirm the usefulness of the model as well as the user interface component. The evaluation provides evidence that (1) the image processing approach manages to address the gap of power line component inspection and (2) that the proposed holistic design knowledge for image-based decision support systems enables more informed decisionmaking. The paper therefore contributes to research and practice in three ways. First, the technical feasibility to detect certain maintenance-intensive parts of power lines with the help of unique UAV image data is shown. Second, the distribution system operators' specific problem is solved by supporting decisions in maintenance with the proposed image-based decision support system. Third, precise design knowledge for image-based decision support systems is formulated that can inform future system designs of a similar nature.With modern-day societies increasingly relying on electrical power, the importance of continuous electricity supply cannot be overlooked. Continuous power supply has two central building blocks -the electricity generation as well as its transmission and distribution to the consumer. From the perspective of transmission or distribution system operators, the maintenance program of the power line infrastructure is crucial in avoiding unexpected disruptions. These system operators have typically adopted conditionbased maintenance programs to minimize the probability of equipment breakdowns (Pagnano et al. 2013; Jalil et al. 2019) . Condition-based maintenance is considered as a three-step process of data acquisition, data processing, and maintenance decision-making (Jardine et al. 2006) , with the last step integrally including maintenance order planning (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2015) .Assessing the condition of the components in an electricity network includes inspecting towers or poles with their connected components, conducting power lines, and the surrounding vegetation of the two previous elements, as it can cause short circuits. Operators routinely examine these aspects regarding faults. Based on the operator's composed inspection reports, maintenance engineers need to compile situation-dependent, well-defined, complete, and prioritized maintenance orders. This requires the consideration of several other factors, such as infrastructure topology, available workforce and skill sets, scheduled infrastructure revision projects, and bundling of maintenance orders. Fast and accurate inspection as well as complete and exhaustive data and information dissemination are crucial for efficient maintenance decision-making and can reduce the risk of power outages due to component failures, increasing the reliability of electricity supply.Traditionally, the inspection is performed through human visual observation by means of manual ground inspection, helicopter-based patrolling, and tower climbing. These inspection methods are costly, time consuming, partly hazardous, do not comprehensively capture data, and are hardly scalable. Recent technical advances in the fields of unmanned aerial vehicles and image processing or computer vision 1 have spurred the development of automated power line inspection. Specifically, deep learning has proven to boost the performance of image processing applications (LeCun et al. 2015) -converging towards human level performance or even surpassing humans (He et al. 2015b) . Researchers are therefore increasingly focusing on the automatic vision-based detection of components and the immediate diagnosis of faults in the inspection of power lines (Liu et al. 2020 ) leaving only the eventual maintenance decision-making for human handling.Previous research on power line maintenance has been scattered, focusing on the technical building blocks. Today, the majority of studies either focus on performing unmanned aerial vehicle inspection flights autonomously (Hui et al. 2018 ) (data acquisition), on task-specific image processing approaches for component detection and fault diagnosis (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) (data processing), or on orchestrating the various technical components (Huang et al. 2018; Homma et al. 2017 ) (interplay between data acquisition and processing). So far, little effort has been devoted to holistic and end-to-end considerations establishing a relationship between the solely technical problems of automating the data acquisition and processing and the need for integrating and transferring the acquired data and extracted information into maintenance decisionmaking. To this end, we conduct a project to design and evaluate a suitable decision support system following the design science research paradigm (Hevner 2007 ) and its common research guidelines (March and Smith 1995; Winter 2008) . We address the ever""]",The user interface component contributes to the design of image-based decision support systems for power line maintenance by presenting the captured information in a way that enables more informed decisions.,reasoning,True
48,What were the results of the ACTT-2 trial for COVID-19 treatment?,"['19 patients. 117 Indeed, baricitinib reduced the immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 patients. A group of 20 patients was treated in an observational, longitudinal trial (IMMU-NOVID) with baricitinib at 4 mg two times per day for 2 days, followed by 4 mg per day for another 7 days (NCT04438629). 118 Treated patients exhibited markedly reduced levels of IL6, IL1β and TNFα, recovery of circulating T and B cells and increased antibody production against the Spike protein. This was associated with a reduction in the need for oxygen therapy. This study suggested that baricitinib can prevent progression to severe disease.Baricitinib reduced lung inflammation in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 119 While viral shedding was not reduced by baricitinib and T cell responses were similar, animals treated with baricitinib showed reduced inflammation, decreased lung infiltration and exhibited a reduction in lung pathological changes. Lung macrophages production of cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation and neutrophil recruitment was reduced by baricitinib. 119 A beneficial effect of baricitinib was reported in COVID-19 moderate pneumonia in a retrospective multicenter study (NCT04358614). 120 In this study baricitinib reduced COVID-19 mortality rate, intensive care unit admissions of COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 viral burden in nasopharyngeal swabs and when used during 14 days, did not induce adverse effects.Results from the trial of the ACTT-2 trial assessing baricitinib plus remdesivir for hospitalized adults with COVID-19 (NCT04401579) 121 give support to the approach of inhibiting JAK1/JAK2 in severe COVID-19 disease. This adaptive, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled phase 3 trial on 1033 patients (515 receiving both drugs and 518 receiving just remdesivir) evaluated baricitinib plus remdesivir in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Remdesivir was administered for ≤10 days, and either baricitinib or placebo (control) for ≤14 days. The primary outcome was time to recovery and a secondary outcome was clinical status at day 15. The Open access combination of baricitinib plus remdesivir was superior to remdesivir alone in both counts with a 1-day shortening of recovery time in the baricitinib arm (median 7 days, 95% CI (6 to 8 days) vs 8 days in the control group, 95% CI (7 to 9 days)) and 30% higher odds of improvement in clinical status at day 15 (OR, 1.3; 95% CI (1.0 to 1.6)). Patients receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation at enrollment had a time to recovery of 10 days with combination treatment and 18 days with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.51; 95% CI (1.10 to 2.08)). The 28-day mortality rate was 5.1% in the combination group and 7.8% in the control group (HR for death, 0.65; 95% CI (0.39 to 1.09)). Thus, baricitinib plus remdesivir was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status among patients with COVID-19, notably among those receiving high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation. Following the result of this trial, the FDA issued on November 19, 2020 an emergency use authorization (EUA) for baricitinib in combination with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 122 The role of addition of glucocorticoids was not evaluated in the ACTT-2 trial, but dexamethasone stayed permitted in standard indications as ARDS. As a matter of fact, the adapative, randomized, blinded controlled phase 3 ACTT-4 trial, which primary objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib in combination with remdesivir vs dexamethasone and remdesivir as assessed by the mechanical ventilation-free survival by day 29, was closed to enrolement in April 2021, prior to full enrolment, after intermediate efficacy analysis found that neither treatment regimen was significantly better than the other. 123 Then, results were announced from the phase 3 COV-BARRIER (NCT04421027) trial of baricitinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 124 The international, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study randomized 1525 patients to baricitinib or standard of care alone.

49,How can virtual platforms be used in resource-constrained settings to reduce the spread of COVID-19?,"[' in the face of adversity. We can draw lessons from the concurrent HIV epidemic, which is running a parallel course with COVID-19 in SA. During the devastating spread of HIV, religious, spiritual, and cultural beliefs played a significant role in mitigating against mental health problems among sufferers, their families, and healthcare workers (29) .According to media reports in SA, gatherings of large groups of people have been responsible for the majority of community spread, the so-called super spreader events 3 ; e.g., the first outbreak in the Free State province occurred following a church gathering. The WHO has repeatedly cautioned that a pandemic like COVID-19 will not be defeated by only scaling up health facilities and resources but also through a change of behavior (20) . Our communities have the responsibility to reduce the spread of this virus by following the nonpharmacological approaches that have been circulated on various public health platforms. Getting individuals to take responsibility for themselves for the good of everyone else is an important message to spread across our communities. The concept of Ubuntu (30), which is defined as humanness-a pervasive spirit of caring and community, harmony and hospitality, respect and responsiveness-that individuals and groups display for one another is strongly encouraged. An organizing concept of Ubuntu is human interdependence, and the driving norms are reciprocity, suppression of self-interest, and the virtue of symbiosis. These concepts can be used in specific conversations about the experiences of being exposed to a pandemic outbreak, with the aim of reinforcing the relational interactions between self-protection and community protection within a cultural context, like it was done in HIV prevention programs (31) .The issue of society, culture, and religious practices in a changing world deserves special mention within the African context, which is characterized by inequities and vulnerabilities. In adapting to the new norms, we should promote and use innovation to enhance social connection and ritual effectiveness, as was the case in Uganda (32) . Many interesting developments have already transformed how rituals are performed, e.g., funerals are livestreamed, highlighting the value of using technology for establishing connection during religious services and funerals. Sadly, in most African communities, access to technology and Application in response to a pandemicEncourage others to adhere to social distancing. Support others from a distance. Do not stigmatize those with COVID 19 symptoms.We all have a role to play in stopping the pandemic. Wear a mask when in public.Adhere to social distancing. Protect the vulnerable individuals. Disclose your symptoms.Share essential resources, such as water, face masks, and hand sanitizers. Protect your family. Protect your colleagues. Protect your community. Save lives. Take the vaccine.Cooperative economics Sharing of resources.Allocating more resources to vulnerable individuals.To work together toward a common goal to end the pandemic.Use innovative ways to connect. Use technology to provide essential services.The virus shall be defeated if we all play our part.other resources that are required to promote these new initiatives is not available due to resource constraints as well as social and racial inequalities. The recommendations published by the WHO encourage the use of virtual platforms, but how these ideas should be operationalized in resource-constrained settings remains to be established through research (20) . We have borrowed from the West African culture the principles of Nguzo-Saba (unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith), which have been repeatedly used in public health interventions such as HIV to motivate behavior changes in order to prevent the spread of the virus within communities (33) . Using the same principles, aligned with the basic concept of Ubuntu, we propose a model to utilize as a public health tool that clearly defines the culturally relevant role of each individual toward reducing the spread of COVID-19. Table 2 below shows the application of the concept of Ubuntu in reducing the spread of COVID-19, which can be used to shape public health messages. It is anticipated that when the large-scale rollout of vaccines occurs, further, challenges will be experienced in terms of the distribution to our large population. Health authorities have published clear guidelines of the vaccine rollout plans, starting with our most vulnerable populations and frontline workers, but in South Africa, there have been anecdotal reports of vaccine fraud among healthy individuals who had the vaccine before their turn (34) . This process will require the application of some of the Ubuntu concepts and principles, where individuals with no vulnerabilities will receive the vaccine at a later stage, and vaccine hesitancy can be discouraged in the same manner. Moreover, the rollout of the vaccine depends on technology, with registrations taking place online. It is through the application of the same Ubuntu principles that we can encourage individuals to support those who are unable to use these technologies or have no access to such so that they are not left out.A large number of questions remain unanswered because the virus has only been around for a short period of time and the long-term effects of social isolation are yet to be experienced']",nan,reasoning,True
