172,What is the purpose of fine-tuning in BERT and how does it relate to pre-training?,"[' before the pandemic."" it would be tokenized to [\'most\', \'v\', \'##a\', \'care\', \'was\', \'provided\', \'in\', \'v\', \'##a\', \'facilities\', \'before\', \'the\', \'pan\', \'##de\', \'##mic\'] with the tokenizer of BioBERT, and the sentence can be also converted into [\'most\', \'va\', \'care\', \'was\', \'provided\', \'in\', \'va\', \'facilities\', \'before\', \'the\', \'pandemic\'] using SciBERT\'s tokenizer. Fig. 1 (b) and Fig. 1 (c) illustrate the extended co-occurrence graph in the wordpiece level for BioBERT and SciBERT, respectively.Since both BioBERT and SciBERT follow the basic structure of BERT, here we only present the inner mechanism of BERT. Given a sample (S, T) from the summarization dataset D, the source word sequence and target word sequence can be represented as S = {w 1 , w 2 , ⋯, w m } with length m and T = {t 1 , t 2 , ⋯, t n } with length n. Then we use BPE tokenizer to obtain corresponding wordpiece sequences of the source sequence as:where w #j i represents the j-th sub-word of the word w i , and k i is the number of sub-words in word w i .In the pre-training process of BERT, the segment token [SEP] is used to separate sentences for the next sentence prediction (NSP) task, and the embedding of [CLS] is used to classify the sentence relationships. To maintain consistency between pre-training and fine-tuning process of BERT, we insert a [CLS] symbol to the head and a [SEP] symbol to the end of the source sequence, before feeding the wordpiece sequence into BERT encoder. Thus, the input wordpiece sequence of BERT can be denoted as:where M is the length of the input wordpiece sequence. BERT model is composed of multiple identical layers of Transformer encoder, which contains the multi-head self-attention module, the layer normalization and position-wise feed forward networks. Since selfattention mechanism considers the sequence as fully connected graph, Transformer-based encoder naturally lacks the capability of capturing positional relations. Thus, BERT encoder should be provided with explicit position embeddings as inter-word position information and segment embeddings as inter-sentence position information.We The contextualized representation of each wordpiececan be obtained as:whereH seq is then input to the graph attention module as the source for knowledge encoder.Graph representation learning aims to learn better vertex representations that are either suited for downstream tasks or have the consistency between vector space and semantic space. Various graph neural networks [10, 47, 48] have been proposed and achieved promising performance. Though Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) [47] is widely used, it is only compatible with transductive tasks and has limited capability of handling unknown vertex in inference process. On the contrary, GraphSAGE (Graph SAmple and aggreGatE) [48] and the Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [10] are proposed to perform inductive learning on graphs. Especially, GAT utilizes the masked selfattention mechanism to capture dependency within neighbors and prevent information flow between disconnected nodes.Therefore, we adopt GAT as knowledge encoder in our proposed approach. Based on the constructed word co-occurrence graphs, GAT propagates linguistic representations from vertex to vertex in the graphs, and updates vertex representations with the embeddings of associated neighbor vertices. Moreover, multi-head attention mechanism is utilized in the graph attention layer to enable the knowledge encoder mine diverse linguistic features from different aspects.To be consistent with the outputs of wordpiece-level sequence encoder, we employ BPE algorithm to the word co-occurrence graph by extending the original vertex into multiple sub-word vertices. We add edges from the head wordpiece to other wordpiece, to guarantee the smooth channels for information propagation between sub-words. Thus, we can smoothly employ the outputs H seq from sequence encoder as the initial node embeddings of nodes in wordpiece level co-occurrence graphs.Given the initial node representations {u 1 , u 2 , ⋯, u M } and the neighbors of i-th node N(u i ) which are inferred from the graph structure, a GAT layer aggregates information from the neighbors and updates the hidden state of the node u i with multi-head attention mechanism as:where [⋅||⋅] denotes the concatenation operation of two vectors, K is the number of heads in multi-head attentions, W k and a k are learnable parameters. The knowledge encoder takes']","The purpose of fine-tuning in BERT is to adapt the pre-trained model to a specific downstream task. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a task-specific dataset with task-specific labels, which allows the model to learn task-specific features and improve its performance on the specific task. Fine-tuning is related to pre-training in that the pre-training process provides the initial knowledge and general language understanding to the model, and fine-tuning builds on top of that by further training the model on task-specific data.","Fine-tuning in BERT refers to the process of taking a pre-trained BERT model and adapting it to a specific downstream task, such as text classification, named entity recognition, or in this context, abstractive summarization. Fine-tuning allows the model to learn task-specific information and nuances from a smaller dataset related to the downstream task. This process involves adjusting the weights of the pre-trained BERT model to better fit the specific task at hand.

The pre-training stage of BERT involves training the model on a vast amount of text data in an unsupervised manner. During pre-training, BERT learns general language representations and contextual relationships between words. This initial pre-training helps BERT understand the structure of language and semantics.

The fine-tuning process builds on this pre-training by allowing the model to adapt to specific tasks or domains. By fine-tuning, the model can adjust its learned representations to better suit the particular characteristics of the target task or dataset, leading to improved performance on that task.

232,What is the impact of IL-1β treatment on the MAPK pathway in A549 cells and the role of the IL-1β/IL-1R axis in A549 cell proliferation?,"[' stimulation, the IL-1β expression in the presence of LPS in intermediate monocytes were increased elevated, while C5aRA could prevent this stimulation (Figure 4(c) ). As shown in Figure 4 (d), ELISA detection of monocyte culture supernatant showed a similar result. Our findings indicated that C5a enhanced IL-1β release from CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes in MPE C5a plays a role in the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of lung cancer cellsTo investigate the role of C5a in the progression of MPE, we first evaluated the effects of C5a on the proliferation of A549 cells. As indicated by Ki-67 expression levels and the CCK-8 assay, C5a subsantially promoted A549 cell proliferation, while C5aRA suppressed it ( Figure 5(a),(b) ). By western blot, we further found that C5a caused a significant increase in the levels of p-AKT and PI3K expression, and this effect could be inhibited by C5aRA (Figure 5(c) ). The PI3K inhibitor LY29f4002 resulted in a decrease in Ki-67-positive A549 cells and a lower proliferation index than C5a treatment alone ( Figure 5(d) ,(e)).As flow cytometry and Western blot results indicated, neither C5a nor C5aRA exerted a significant effect on the Figure 5 (h),(i), the apoptosis of A549 cells and the protein levels of cleaved-Caspase 3 and Bax were significantly decreased in the C5a + DDP group, while they were elevated in the C5aRA + DDP group, and C5a could reverse the increase in apoptosis caused by C5aRA.We then sought to investigate whether C5a was involved in the regulation of tumor cell migration and invasion. As soon as 24 h after wounding, C5a showed promoting effects on A549 wound closure ( Figure 5(j) ). Unexpectedly, incubation with C5aRA alone had no effects on A549 migration, while it was harmful to C5a-enhanced A549 cell wound healing ( Figure 5(j) ). As expected, the addition of C5a strongly promoted tumor invasion activity. Although the addition of C5aRA alone did not affect this invasion activity, it significantly suppressed the invasion activity increased by C5a (Figure 5(k) ).The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) was significantly elevated after C5a treatment, which could be abolished by the addition of C5aRA ( Figure 5(l) ). An adhesion assay further confirmed that a significant number of A549 cells adhered to the PMC monolayer within 24 h. As expected, C5a strongly enhanced adhesion, while C5aRA abrogated the enhanced adhesion activity of tumor cells and PMCs ( Figure 5(m) ). Moreover, Western blot results demonstrated that the levels of N-cadherin and vimentin, markers of mesenchymal cells, were significantly increased in C5a-treated A549 cells, whereas the expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial cell marker, was severely decreased. Our results also indicated that C5aRA had the opposite effect on EMT in A549 cells as C5a (Figure 5(n) ).As shown in Figure 6(a),(b) , Ki-67 expression and the proliferation index of A549 cells were increased in the presence of IL-1β, and this effect was dramatically inhibited by the IL-1R antagonist (IL-1RA). The MAPK pathway is the bestknown signaling pathway in the development of cancer and regulates important cellular processes such as proliferation. We then assessed the protein levels of MAPK and p-MAPK in treated A549 cells and found that IL-1β treatment resulted in a significant increase in the levels of MAPK and (Figure 6(c) ). Our data showed that apoptosis was significantly lower in IL-1β-treated cells than in untreated control cells, while the IL-1β receptor antagonist significantly stimulated the apoptosis of A549 cells (Figure 6(d) ,(e)).As the wound-healing assay showed, there was a significant decline in A549 migration in the IL-1RA group compared to the control group after 36 h (Figure 6(f) ). As the transwell assay showed, in the presence of IL-1β, tumor invasion activity was promoted, while the addition of IL-1RA significantly prevented the increase in invasion capability caused by IL-1β (Figure 6(g) ).In addition, IL-1β significantly induced ICAM-1 expression in lung cancer cells, and this effect was abolished by the addition of IL-1']",IL-1β treatment results in a significant increase in the levels of MAPK and p-MAPK in A549 cells. The IL-1β/IL-1R axis plays a role in A549 cell proliferation.,"The IL-1β treatment in A549 cells leads to a tendency towards the upregulation of MAPK/p-MAPK expression, suggesting that the MAPK signaling pathway might be involved in how IL-1β induces the growth of tumor cells. Additionally, the IL-1β/IL-1R axis has been shown to promote the proliferation of A549 cells in vitro by increasing Ki-67 expression and the proliferation index of A549 cells. The IL-1R antagonist (IL-1RA) was able to dramatically inhibit this effect on cell proliferation.","What is the impact of IL-1β treatment on the MAPK pathway in A549 cells and the role of the IL-1β/IL-1R axis in A549 cell proliferation? ->: The IL-1β treatment in A549 cells leads to a tendency towards the upregulation of MAPK/p-MAPK expression, suggesting that the MAPK signaling pathway might be involved in how IL-1β induces the growth of tumor cells.

18,What is the role of cytokine storm in the severe evolution of COVID-19?,"[' (CALR) 68 69 that endow mutated CALR proteins the ability to bind and activate the same TpoR in the absence of ligand. [70] [71] [72] [73] Thus, for this very large group of diseases with increasing prevalence (0.4-0.7/1000, 5 times higher than chronic myeloid leukemia induced by the BCR-Abelson kinase (ABL) fusion protein) the cause is persistent activation of JAK2 in clonal HSCs, which gives a major advantage to progenitors of red blood cells, platelets and granulocytes, leading to clonal expansion of these lineages in the absence of cytokines.In the same time with the identification of JAK2 V617F it was shown that homologous mutations activate constitutively JAK1 (V658F) and TYK2 (V678F) 66 and these and other activating mutations were identified in T-acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL), in B-ALL and several other conditions. 74 75 Overall, these findings provided an impetus to search for potent inhibitors of JAKs.The second reason why JAKs became prime targets for the pharmaceutical industry is represented by excessive activation of cytokines and their receptors in autoimmune diseases. The prime targets were members of the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21 and especially the two JAK proteins associated with subunits of this group, namely JAK1 and JAK3. 76 Inhibitors were thus seeked that could inhibit JAK1 and JAK3, or only JAK3. Such inhibitors were discovered and it was found that only inhibiting JAK3 exerts a much weaker effect than inhibiting JAK1 and JAK3, implying that JAK1 is the dominant JAK, 77 and that JAK3 needs to be present in the complex, as a scaffold, but its catalytic activity is not as crucial as that of JAK1. 77 78 Indeed, absence of JAK3 has a blocking effect while inhibiting the kinase domain only exerts a minor effect. 77 79 More recently, increased interest in JAKi strategies arose for the need of new treatments for pathological inflammatory conditions like hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) where overactive T cells and macrophages secrete numerous proinflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18 and TNF-α, involving the JAK-STAT pathway. 80 Samewise in COVID-19, the JAK-STAT pathway is implicated in complement hyperactivation in SARS-CoV-2-infected respiratory epithelial cells 81 and in the activation of CD4 + and CD8 + positive T cells, NK cells and monocytes which cooperate with elevated levels of IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-17. Indeed, very high levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-α and G-CSF were described in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care. 82 Furthermore, JAK-STAT activation promotes senescence of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, which amplifies inflammation. 83 Therefore, JAKi, and especially JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, were suggested as a potential therapy against systemic inflammation in COVID-19 84 because treatment with a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor to prevent lung injury in severe COVID-19 would be able to reduce cytokine action more effectively than blocking one cytokine at a time (like IL-6. 85 The major strategy used for obtaining kinase inhibitors is to obtain compounds that prevent ATP entrance in the ATP binding pocket. ATP is obligatory as a source of phosphate for catalysis. The small molecule inhibitor may bind and compete with ATP, or may bind to close-by sites or distant sites that allosterically prevent ATP binding to the ATP pocket. The kinase inhibitors may bind to active kinases and inhibit them (type I) or may bind to the inactive kinase, and block the transition to active kinase (type II). 86 The very well-known kinase inhibitor imatinib inhibits the Abelson kinase (ABL), PDGF receptor and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases. Imatinib binds to kinases when they are inactive (type II), thus preventing activation. All current JAKi used in the clinics so far are type I inhibitors, and they only recognize and bind kinase domain of JAKs in their active conformation. This is on one hand a limitation, as prebinding activation is a prerequisite for binding, hence pathological signaling occurs at a certain point, but on the other hand the', 'Open access JAK inhibitors and COVID-19\nDuring SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response can be inhibited or delayed, and the subsequent persistent viral replication can induce emergency signals that may culminate in a cytokine storm contributing to the severe evolution of COVID-19. Cytokines are key regulators of the immune response and virus clearance, and, as such, are linked to the-possibly altered-response to the SARS-CoV-2. They act via a family of more than 40 transmembrane receptors that are coupled to one or several of the 4 Janus kinases (JAKs) coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Once activated, JAKs act on pathways for either survival, proliferation, differentiation, immune regulation or, in the case of type I interferons, antiviral and antiproliferative effects. Studies of graft-versus-host and systemic rheumatic diseases indicated that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) exert immunosuppressive effects that are non-redundant with those of corticotherapy. Therefore, they hold the potential to cut-off pathological reactions in COVID-19. Significant clinical experience already exists with several JAKi in COVID-19, such as baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and nezulcitinib, which were suggested by a meta-analysis (Patoulias et al.) to exert a benefit in terms of risk reduction concerning major outcomes when added to standard of care in patients with COVID-19. Yet, only baricitinib is recommended in first line for severe COVID-19 treatment by the WHO, as it is the only JAKi that has proven efficient to reduce mortality in individual randomized clinical trials (RCT), especially the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) and COV-BARRIER phase 3 trials. As for secondary effects of JAKi treatment, the main caution with baricitinib consists in the induced immunosuppression as long-term side effects should not be an issue in patients treated for COVID-19. We discuss whether a class effect of JAKi may be emerging in COVID-19 treatment, although at the moment the convincing data are for baricitinib only. Given the key role of JAK1 in both type I IFN action and signaling by cytokines involved in pathogenic effects, establishing the precise timing of treatment will be very important in future trials, along with the control of viral replication by associating antiviral molecules.Cytokine receptors and the Janus kinase-signal transducers and Activators of transcription pathway Cytokines are alpha-helical proteins of [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] aminoacids that are secreted and act on target cells as a function of expression and exposure on their surface of specific receptors. They are fundamentally required for blood formation and regulation of the immune response. In blood formation, on commitment to differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), lineage specific cytokines regulate the survival, proliferation and differentiation of progenitors and the final blood levels. 1 Cytokines act via specific cytokine receptors. The human genome codes for over 40 cytokine receptors. They all signal via Janus kinases (JAKs), initially called Just Another Kinases, that are appended non-covalently to their cytosolic tails. Four JAKs are coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Activated receptors induce via JAKs the activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). There are 7 STATs coded by the human genome. Several receptors use the same JAKs and sharing of JAKs allows specific signals by the different receptors and cytokines, but different outputs. 1 The cytokine receptor superfamily is divided in type 1 and type 2 families (figure 1) and this distinction is derived from different sequence features, such as conserved WSXWS motifs in the extracellular domains and boxes 1 and 2 motifs in the cytosolic domains for type 1 (figure 2A). 1 The type 1 family consists of homodimeric receptors (for Epo, Tpo, GCSF, Growth Hormone, Prolactin), heterodimeric receptors (for IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF), using JAK2, hetero-oligomeric receptors, using JAK1 and to some extent JAK2 and TYK2 (represented by the IL6 family receptors), 2 and finally the gamma chain using receptors (namely those for IL']",The cytokine storm can contribute to the severe evolution of COVID-19.,"The cytokine storm in COVID-19 is thought to play a significant role in the severe evolution of the disease. It is believed that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response can be inhibited or delayed, leading to persistent viral replication that can induce emergency signals resulting in a cytokine storm. This excessive release of cytokines, which are key regulators of the immune response, can lead to hyperinflammation and tissue damage, contributing to the severe outcomes seen in some COVID-19 patients. The cytokine storm is correlated with a decrease in certain immune cells, an increase in certain markers like D-dimers, and can lead to organ dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death in severe cases.","What is the role of cytokine storm in the severe evolution of COVID-19? ->: The cytokine storm in COVID-19 is thought to play a significant role in the severe evolution of the disease.

90,What mental health challenges do Canadian Veterans face and how does media affect public perceptions of them?,"[""Media coverage of Canadian Veterans, with a focus on post traumatic stress disorder and suicide\nThe Government of Canada estimates that there are around 620,000 Veterans of the Canadian Armed Forces, 88% of whom are men and 12% are women [1] . Around 25,000 of these served in World War II or the Korean war, while around 40,000 served in the recent Afghanistan conflict [1] . Considerable research indicates that these Veterans are at a higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes than the general population. For example, a large-scale survey revealed that 13% of regular force Veterans had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), compared to 1% of the adult Canadian population, after adjusting for age and sex [2] . This survey also found that 17% of Veterans had been diagnosed with a mood disorder such as depresion, and 11% with an anxiety disorder, which was over the double the rate of the adult Canadian population after adjusting for age and sex. Moreover, Veterans are significantly more likely to die by suicide than similarly-aged non-Veterans, with recent studies indicating that Canadian Veterans have a 1.4-1.8 higher risk of suicide than other Canadian adults when controlling for age and sex [3, 4] . Furthermore, evidence suggests that Veterans have difficulty finding secure housing, employment and communal support on leaving the military [5, 6] . This is due to a variety of factors, but some research indicates that military Veterans are sometimes stigmatized and negatively stereotyped by various sectors of society, leading to discrimination and neglect [7] .A large corpus of research indicates that the media plays a key role in shaping public beliefs, opinions and attitudes towards social groups and related societal issues, especially when the public has little social contact with the group in question [8, 9] . For example, some research indicates that the stigma associated with mental illnesses such as PTSD is fueled by sensational media coverage that often focuses on rare cases of crime and violence, with little coverage of recovery and rehabilitation [10] [11] [12] [13] . This can contribute to a wider climate of prejudice and fear, which can lead to the social exclusion and social alienation of people with mental illnesses [8] .Some US research indicates that military Veterans are framed in a stereotypical and narrow manner in the American media. For example, one recent review paper notes that US media portrayals of Veterans commonly emphasize factors such as trauma, emotional instability and drugs/alcohol [14] . Similarly, a report from the US Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration [15] notes a lack of positive well-rounded stories, instead lamenting the common use of negative and stigmatizing depictions such as 'ticking time bombs' or 'damaged and potentially unstable' when referring to American Veterans.Furthermore, recent research indicates that Veterans are also frequently portrayed as helpless victims in news articles. One US study of two high-circulation newspapers found that 87% of all articles mentioning recent Veterans framed them as victims, with 15% specifying a mental health problem in the article [16] . This overlaps with other US research, which found that US regional newspapers frequently framed Veterans as 'charity cases' or 'victims' mistreated by society [17] .These negative stereotypes may manifest themselves most intensely in media stories about PTSD or suicide in Veterans. For example, research from various countries shows that media coverage of PTSD often focuses on crime and violence, with fewer articles on recovery or rehabilitation [18] [19] [20] [21] . Similarly, a US study of media coverage of Veteran suicide found that 60% of articles included sensational/dramatic language, 60% attributed Veteran suicide to a single cause and 40% included suicide in the headline, while 0 % contained help-seeking information or quoted suicide experts, thus deviating from responsible reporting of suicide guidelines [22] .All this led the US National Veterans Foundation [23] to state that 'the media is the main culprit in fostering negative stereotypes about Veterans' , with Erwin [14] similarly noting that negative coverage creates inaccurate 'public perceptions of veterans as emotionally unstable citizens on the verge of breakdown' . Some research indicates that this can contribute to a wider climate of suspicion and fear, which can impede the reintegration of Veterans into society.For example, one US study [24] found that Veterans reported that people often perceived them as 'crazy' , 'dangerous' or 'violent' , while another US study [25] found that hiring managers often held negative stereotypes that Veterans are 'bitter' , 'angry' or 'withdrawn' . These beliefs and associated behaviours may stem from the aforementioned negative media coverage, with a recent US experimental study finding that participants who read a short stereotypical news article about Veterans significantly increased their social distance to Veterans as a consequence [26] .The vast majority of research on media coverage of Veterans has occurred in the United States, and to our knowledge there are no published studies examining Canadian media coverage of Veterans per se, let""]","Canadian Veterans face challenges such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mood disorders like depression, and anxiety disorders.

182,"Can the DCA model predict new SARS-CoV-2 variants by identifying favorable mutability scores, and how does it compare to other models and experimental protein expression?","[""2 variants are significantly better according to the model than randomly mutated sequences, i.e. the naturally occurring mutations are, according to the model, significantly more neutral than the predominantly deleterious random mutations, as is to be expected by evolution under purifying selection. This finding indicates the capacity of DCA trained on diverged homologs to capture local constraints acting on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.The combination of these two observations is key for our work: the epistatic model is able to capture mutational effects, and the SARS-CoV-2 variants, which emerged over the last months, are significantly more neutral than random mutations. Can we use this to predict possible new variants of SARS-CoV-2 by identifying positions with favorable mutability scores? To test this idea, we compare the currently observable SARS-CoV-2 variability with the one predicted using the modelbased mutability score, and with the mutations expectable by the experimental protein expression. As mentioned before and illustrated in Fig. 1 , we operationally assess the observable variability by the number of distinct GISAID sequences having a variant amino acid (compared to the reference Wuhan-Hu-1) in the specific position under study. We observe that the DCA model and expression are similarly correlated with variability (Spearman's ρ=0.61 and 0.6, respectively), while the correlation is weaker for the IND model (ρ=0.34). This trend can also be observed in Fig. 2C by looking at the distribution of mutational scores after grouping positions by their observed variability, they grow accordingly with the variability (note that the scores are not comparable between methods, but p-values indicate a higher significance for DCA and expression than for IND).We analyze in detail the performance of these different measures as a predictor of SARS-CoV-2 mutability through Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC curves) and the resulting areas under curve (AUC), which range from 0.5 for random to 1.0 for perfect predictions. We perform the ROC analysis using a variability cutoff of 12, because it splits the set of positions into two balanced subsets of positions with low (≤12, n=93) or high (>12, n=85) variability. The DCA model and protein expression (AUC 0.76 and 0.77) show a remarkable performance in distinguishing positions with low or high variability, clearly outperforming the IND model (AUC 0.63). This result is not dependent on the particular cutoff chosen, as a similar trend is observed for a large range of variability cutoffs (Fig. S2B) . The protein expression and the DCA model perform similarly (see Fig.  S2B , averaged ROC AUC of 0.83 and 0.81, respectively), followed by the IND model (0.66). The experiment-based predictor performs comparatively better at high variability while the sequencebased ones are better at low variability (Fig. S2B) , which is probably related to the fact that highly conserved positions are usually very relevant to the function of the protein (34) . In conclusion, we observe that the different measures have a substantial predictive power of the mutability, although the IND model is worse compared to the others. The performance of the DCA models is surprisingly competitive, with a similar performance as the experimental measurements, with an advantage for lower mutabilities and a slight disadvantage for higher mutabilities, cf. Fig. 2B .The performance measured in the previous analysis is not only dependent on the intrinsic predictive power of each method but how well the ground truth is defined, in this case the variability estimated from GISAID data. Although only a fraction of all possible variants emerged in the short time since SARS-CoV-2 appeared, the observed variability has greatly evolved over time due to the great effort of sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Fig. S2A) . As an example, the number of RBD positions without observed variants has shrunk from 58 out of 178 in July 2020, to only 3 in May 2021. Interestingly, we observe a great increase in predictive performance when evaluated against more recent and richer variant libraries considered in the estimation of variability. As shown in Fig.  2E , the performance has increased from an AUC of only 0.52 considering sequences collected until July 2020 up to 0.76 with sequences until May 2021 (at each timepoint, the median variability is used to partition data into low vs. high variability, cf. Fig. S2B and Materials and Methods for details). This improvement is not only evident from the ROC analysis, but also by looking at the correlation between the DCA model and the variability with Spearman correlations of ρ=0.13, 0.35 and 0.61 in July 2020, December 2020 and May 2021, respectively, cf.

Characteristics that were not part of the matching process for case-patients and controls were compared using χ 2 tests, Fisher exact tests, or t tests. We used exact conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs), 95% mid-p CIs, and exact p values for potential risk factors for MERS-CoV illness. Factors found to be significant (p<0.05) in the univariate analysis were further evaluated in multivariable analyses.We created a final multivariable model through stepwise elimination of nonsignificant variables until all remaining variables in the multivariate model were significant at p<0.05. Interactions between risk factors were also evaluated in the multivariable analyses.During March 16-November 13, 2014, a total of 535 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection were reported to the MoH. After screening based on the exclusion criteria, 34 patients were identified as possible primary case-patients. Two persons refused to participate, and 2 did not meet the age criteria for inclusion. The remaining 30 case-patients, representing 8 of 13 regions in Saudi Arabia, were enrolled in the study (Figure) . Symptom onset dates for enrolled case-patients ranged from February 25 through November 2, 2014.We identified and included 116 controls: 4 age-, sex-and neighborhood-matched controls for each of 28 case-patients and 2 controls for each of the 2 remaining case-patients. Of the 116 controls, ages for 6 exceeded the age-matching criteria by 1-5 years. One case-patient did not have a formal residence; after his interview, 4 controls were selected from the vicinity of the area where he spent his nights.Case-patients and controls were interviewed during June 8-November 29, 2014. Interviews with case-patients and controls were conducted on the same day, a median of 27 days (range 0-192 days, interquartile range 12-70 days) after case-patients' illness onsets.Median age of case-patients was 49 years; 97% were male ( Table 1) . Rate of ownership of a barn or farm with animals was similar between case-patients and controls, but income was higher for case-patients than for controls (53% vs. 34%, respectively, had a monthly income of >6,000 SAR [US $1,600]; 2013 gross national income per capita is $2,188/month in Saudi Arabia [27] ). Other demographic features between the groups were similar. At the time of interview, 7 (23%) case-patients were deceased, and 10 (33%) were too ill to be interviewed. For these 17 (57%) case-patients and for 1 (1%) control, a family member served as proxy. Case-patients interviewed by proxy were more likely than those interviewed directly to have underlying medical conditions but were similar in age, other demographic characteristics, and animal-related exposures.Several exposures were associated with MERS-CoV by univariate analysis (Table 2) . During the 14 days before illness onset, case-patients were more likely than controls to have had direct dromedary exposure (33% vs. 15%, OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.24-11.80); to keep dromedaries in or around the home (30% vs. 15%, OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.04-10.98); or to have visited a farm where dromedaries were present (90% vs. 53%, OR 11.57, 95% CI 2.67-∞); Among those who visited a farm where livestock were kept during the exposure period, case-patients were more likely than controls to have milked dromedaries (50% vs. 23%, OR 10.36, 95% CI 2.47-∞).

119,How can CNNs improve decision-making in outdoor applications by combining image understanding and metadata?,"["" image understanding (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) despite the challenging conditions of outdoor application. CNNs provide a method for automatically learning features in images, which can drastically reduce the effort in hand-designing solutions and improve generalization. In summary, this makes its application promising for the analysis of images containing PLCs (Jalil et al. 2019; Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Prates et al. 2019) . Consequently, based on the assumption that all relevant components are captured in images, they can be extracted using DL. In particular, the assessment of a component's condition features is determined by two factors. First, the component needs to be detected in the captured image, containing one or more component objects. Second, each detected component requires component-specific fault diagnosis. The system should therefore include these two tasks performed by a DL approach.DP2 -Image processing: Provide the system with state-of-the art deep learning for the detection and fault diagnosis of components.Images containing PLCs form the basis of the IB-DSS for vision-based maintenance. However, without any additional information the images can hardly be seen as sufficient for a system designed for component maintenance. To enable MEs in their decision-making, metadata (Sen 2004) regarding the images or contained components is required. The primary purpose of this metadata is to provide context (DR2) to the reported data and therefore provide enriching information that leads to knowledge creation (Nicola 2005) . It can describe both physical (e.g., towers and insulators) as well as digital objects (e.g., images and documents) through providing values or information for certain characteristics (Clobridge 2010) . The main purpose of attaching metadata to a data item is to uniquely identify it in a system and to find it by browsing or searching (Burgin 2016) . In the PLM, metadata can range from geographical and temporal image tags all the way to geographical location, age, history, et cetera of the individual infrastructure components. However, the main consideration to be taken here is that the physical objects, such as towers, insulators, or conductors, are to be considered the focal data as they represent the maintained infrastructure. The captured images contain information about these components and should therefore be appropriately linked, at best based on the individual component.DP3 -Metadata: Provide the system with metadata.The availability of context in the form of simple metadata such as the geographic location and a time stamp or advanced/processed metadata such as the object location, object type, and binary fault presence adds valuable information to an IB-DSS. However, in terms of context for the individual fault contained in an image, these details are of limited help. In the light of fault diagnosis, the required context (DR2) should be defined as parts of it that can be accessed to clarify and understand the fault. The combination of the contextualized fault diagnosis as well as visualization of the extracted information (DR5) directly results in necessary interpretability of the decision in the fault diagnosis. Consequently, the decision of the fault diagnosis should be interpretable for MEs such that they are able to comprehend why for instance an insulator was marked as faulty. Thereby, we adapt the definition of Miller (2019) [p. 14] referring to interpretability as ''the degree to which an observer can understand the cause of a decision''. The interpretability of the results of the fault diagnosis provides MEs with additional information (context) at a PLC level which in turn enhances their ability to make high-quality decisions.DP4 -Interpretability: Provide the system with interpretable fault diagnosis.To facilitate decision-making in PLM, we found that acquired and processed data should be visualized (DR5) to the respective users in order to determine a fault's existence, location, and significance. Because such a user interface can be considered as the ''source of many of the power, flexibility, and ease of use'' (Turban et al. 2010, p. 100) of a DSS, it requires careful consideration. MEs face a situation where they need to compile well-defined, complete, and prioritized maintenance orders with a variety of details and latent information requiring their consideration. An appropriate interface should therefore harness visual data exploration (Keim 2002) by integrating its user into the data exploration process by applying their perceptual abilities. It can help the personnel to answer the mission critical questions such as the required equipment and achieve high decision quality regarding maintenance prioritization.DP5 -Visual data exploration: Provide the system with an interface for visual data exploration.To improve the planning and scoping of individual maintenance orders, enhanced data and information quality needs to be provided to MEs. By following the prescribed tentative DPs for an IB-DSS our designed and evaluated artifact provides evidence of achieving this objective. The artifact is integrated into our case company by deriving specific capabilities to satisfy the DPs, termed design features (DFs) (Meth""]",CNNs can improve decision-making in outdoor applications by combining image understanding and metadata through providing a method for automatically learning features in images and by enriching the information with context provided by metadata.,"CNNs can improve decision-making in outdoor applications by combining image understanding with metadata in the following ways:

183,How did the lack of sterile gowns and medical carts in the ICU during the pandemic contribute to patient-to-patient transmission?,"["" period required rapid operational changes that can significantly challenge the ability of healthcare staff to respect fully the usual infection control practices aimed at reducing the patient-topatient transmission of pathogens that frequently contaminate a hospital environment. For example, during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, Yap et al (3) observed an increase in methicillin-resistant S. aureus acquisition in the ICU and suggested that the excessive use of gloves (especially when worn together with long-sleeved gowns) may have contributed to reducing compliance to hand hygiene and the advised practice of changing gloves and cleansing hands before and after each contact with a patient, and between caring for dirty and clean body-sites in the same patient.A careful reassessment of the infection control procedures adopted in our ICU during the emergency phase of the pandemic revealed two major critical issues that may have increased the risk of cross contamination: there was a shortage of sterile gowns during the first 7 days of the epidemic and the two-bedded rooms were equipped with only one medical cart. Medical charts are prone to surface contamination, since they are handled by physicians, nurses, and other medical staff several times a day. In specific, medical carts are considered high-touch surfaces accounting for a median of three touches per operator's interaction (28) .It is also worth noting that our usual practice of screening patients for MDR microorganisms upon admission and putting possibly colonized/infected patients in preventive isolation could not be fully implemented during the study period, because the ICU was rapidly overwhelmed and there were only three single rooms that could be used for isolation purposes. At the same time, the antimicrobial stewardship service provided by infectious diseases specialists had to be reduced. It is, therefore, possible that the combination of all of these factors played a role in favoring episodes of cross-contamination that eventually increased the number of bacteramia episodes in our extremely fragile population.In particular, our finding that a high percentage (83.7%) of patients who developed Enterococcus bacteremia had stayed in the same room for overlapping periods or within few weeks suggests that the degree of nosocomial transmission might have been relevant.Unfortunately, we could not extend our genotyping analysis to all of the Enterococcus species isolates in order to verify the hypothesis of a point source outbreak, because local policy requires only the routine collection and storage of MDR organisms for the purposes of microbiological surveillance. However, the results of our genotyping analyses of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains collected from five patients whose intubation periods overlapped support the view that cross-transmission may have accounted for only some of the observed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus-related BSIs.Finally, another possible explanation for the unexpectedly high frequency of BSIs due to Enterococcus species may be the disruption of the gut barrier caused by SARS-CoV-2. As it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 productively infects human gut enterocytes (29) , it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, which is a known risk factor for the development of BSIs. Pathologic studies are needed to shed light on the possible enteric barrier damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 such as that previously found to be associated with SARS-CoV-1 (30) .Our study has a number of limitations. First, its single-centre design and the evolving nature of the setting limit the generalizability of the findings; however, we believe that our findings can be generalized to other contexts and settings in which an unexpectedly high flow of critically ill COVID-19 patients exceeds the capacity of healthcare facilities (31) . Second, the lack of comparative data (historical or from other hospital settings) makes it difficult to ascertain how much weight should be given to SARS-CoV-2 infection itself or the organizational changes in explaining the observed increase in the frequency of BSIs. In particular, the available evidence concerning BSI episodes in critically ill patients is representative of quite different settings that were not overwhelmed by the surge of the pandemic (i.e., low-threshold ICU admissions involving a smaller percentage of mechanically ventilated patients). Third, the conduction of a prospective study with the collection of microbiological samples was not feasible due to the contingency of the pandemic. Thus, the retrospective design of the study made it impossible to genotype all of the Enterococcus species strains and only the MDR strains collected for surveillance purposes were available to test the hypothesis of between-patient cross-contamination. Finally, the high short-term mortality rate and small sample size prevented us from assessing the impact of the BSIs on in-ICU mortality (18) .An abrupt surge in the number of critically ill COVID-19 patients seems to have a detrimental effect on the frequency of ICU-acquired BSIs (particularly Enterococcus-""]",The lack of sterile gowns and medical carts in the ICU during the pandemic may have contributed to patient-to-patient transmission by increasing the risk of cross-contamination.,"The lack of sterile gowns and medical carts in the ICU during the pandemic could have contributed to patient-to-patient transmission in the following ways:

1. Shortage of Sterile Gowns: The shortage of sterile gowns may have led to the reuse of gowns, which can increase the risk of cross-contamination between patients if proper infection control practices were not followed due to limited resources.

2. Lack of Medical Carts: Having only one medical cart for two-bedded rooms means that the same cart was shared between patients. Medical carts are high-touch surfaces prone to contamination, and if not properly disinfected between patient uses, they can serve as a source for transmitting pathogens between patients.

In summary, the lack of sterile gowns and medical carts could have compromised infection control practices, leading to an increased risk of patient-to-patient transmission of pathogens in the ICU during the pandemic.","How did the lack of sterile gowns and medical carts in the ICU during the pandemic contribute to patient-to-patient transmission? ->: The lack of sterile gowns and medical carts in the ICU during the pandemic could have contributed to patient-to-patient transmission in the following ways:

This increased the risk of transmission of the virus from patient to patient, as healthcare workers were not adequately protected from exposure"
254,How many cytokines are measured in CRS-causing virus studies and what factors contribute to the variation in the number of measured cytokines?,"[' we first assessed how comparable the number of different cytokines measured in these studies was across the five CRS-causing viruses. Figure 2 shows how variable this number is between virus-specific studies (e.g., 15 for H5N1 and 26 for SARS-CoV-2). This variation reflects (i) the increasing interest developed for CRS-causing pathologies over recent years (26 recent studies reported cytokine measurement for SARS-CoV-2 against only 10 H5N1-related studies) and (ii) the increased availability and sensitivity of the multiplex detection method.The influenza A viruses trigger an increase in all cytokine levels measured (Figure 2 , yellow). In contrast, during infection with each of the β-coronaviruses, some cytokines were detected at levels normally found in control groups (blue). This indicates that β-coronaviruses can subvert the immune response, reflecting different kinetics and pathogenesis between the influenzaand coronavirus-associated diseases. Of note, studies of H5N1 infections showed that a few cytokines were increased compared with control groups, and no change was observed in other studies (36, 52) , illustrating the greater complexity of these diseases, probably due to the multifactorial nature of the mechanisms involved. Table 1 shows the number of cytokines whose levels are increasing in one, two, three, four or all five virus-related infections from the interrogated literature. Only five cytokines were modulated regardless of the virus-associated disease concerned, with 20 other cytokines being shared to some degree. Increased levels observed in 16 cytokines were unique to a single virus at a time. It is important to keep in mind that the amplitude of change in the cytokines is not considered, which can be different between the different diseases, adding to the heterogeneity of those severe respiratory infectious diseases. This backs up the highly complex nature of the associated diseases as well as the past and current struggles to develop efficient vaccines and treatments.To examine the presence of the measured cytokines and directionality of their change, we constructed a heatmap of the included viruses and cytokine responses.The Cytokine Response to SARS-CoV-2 Sits in Between the Ones Given to Other β-coronaviruses and Influenza A VirusesWe used a hierarchic clustering algorithm on the viruses using Jaccard distance and complete linkage, clustering them based on the cytokine responses they cause. The method groups the pathogens in three clusters. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV comprise the coronavirus cluster, and H5N1 and H7N9 form the influenza cluster, while SARS-CoV-2 sits in an individual cluster (Figure 3) , slightly closer to the two influenza A viruses than to the two β-coronaviruses.The cluster analysis of cytokines defines eight clusters, based on the direction of their modulation upon infection with each virus. It is important to note that the results of this cluster analysis are biased by the missing information for some cytokines. Bearing this in mind, it is worth looking into the detailed patterns of cytokine responses of the various CRS-inducing viruses. The cytokine cluster I includes the pro-inflammatory, TNF-α, and two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-2 and IL-10. All of them had mixed results in SARS-CoV-2, while encompassing all three categories of results for the other two coronavirus infections, which were predominantly increased during influenza infections. Unfortunately, cluster II seems to be restricted to cytokines measured only in H7N9-mediated infections, preventing us from comparing influenza A viruses vs. with β-coronaviruses. Clusters III and VI carry the generally increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are elevated for almost all of the viruses but not measured in all of the cases of cluster VI. Among those cytokines are IFN-α and IFN-γ, typical representatives of the general antiviral response (type-I and type-II IFNs), as well as IL-6, one of the most prominent pro-inflammatory cytokines, along various chemokines. Cytokines from Cluster IV measured during coronavirus infections do not fluctuate, while most of them are elevated during an influenza infection, e.g., IL-4 and IL-5 upon H7N9 infections. IL-4 is involved in Th2 differentiation, and the Th2 cells can produce IL-5 to mitigate eosinophil infiltration (53) . Such differences observed between virus-specific pathologies reflect the strong alterations observed in coronavirus infections, particularly SARS-CoV-2 (54) . The cytokines in Cluster VII and VIII do not always respond to SARS-CoV-2: IL-15 and CCL5 (RANTES) are not elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection. IL']",The number of cytokines measured in CRS-causing virus studies varies between different viruses.

164,How does the virus in the body affect memory response and immune stimulations?,"[' being studied in detail with respect to infectivity, cytopathic effect 21 and sensitivity to vaccine. 22 23 Persistence of virus in the body, 24 especially in the gut, 25 given the enterocyte replication of the virus 26 or only of transcripts from short integrated viral RNAs 27 may contribute to memory response and may impact disease and other immune stimulations. Furthermore, long-term replication in the context of immunosuppression may promote selection for mutants of SARS-CoV-2. [28] [29] [30] Immunopathology in CoVId-19 and previously described sArs CoV and MErs infections Experience with severe SARS-CoV-1 and MERS pointed to a major feature of these infections, which is to induce a delayed cytokine storm following an initially insufficient induction and action of type I interferons (IFN). 31 32 The same has been clearly observed with SARS-CoV-2 which induces a biphasic disease consisting first of a flu-like phase, followed by a pulmonary and systemic disease, which pathological cytokine action and inflammation may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).In a standard viral infection, the viral genome and proteins induce, via Toll-like receptors, activation of the transcription factors required for rapid and sustained synthesis of type I IFNs alpha (produced by leucocytes, 17 subtypes) and beta (fibroblasts), epsilon (produced by reproductive tract epithelium), kappa (produced by epidermal keratinocytes) and omega (produced by leucocytes and is divergent from IFNs alpha and beta). There are 13 forms of IFN-alpha and 1 IFN-omega, which is closely related phylogenetically. IFN-epsilon and kappa are less homologous. 33 34 All human 17 individual type I IFNs bind to the same receptor, 35 36 namely the type I IFN receptor (heterodimer constituted of one IFNAR2 binding subunit, linked to JAK1, and one IFNAR1 signaling subunit, linked to TYK2) (figure 3), 3 which induce, via a specific complex composed of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9, genes that code for proteins that mediate an antiviral state in the neighboring cells. 37 These IFNs are secreted by the initially infected cells and act on neighboring cells, inducing an antiviral state. As a consequence, the neighboring cells are protected and the antigen presenting cells can induce the adaptive immune response, composed of B cells that under the help of T cells will generate the plasmocytes that secrete Open access neutralizing antibodies and also the formation of CD8 + cytotoxic T cells that will recognize and kill infected cells. Patients that exhibit anti-type I IFN antibodies or genetic defects in IFN induction mechanisms evolve towards a severe disease. 38 39 Remarkably, autoantibodies against type I IFNs with neutralizing capacity are present in approximately 4% of uninfected individuals over 70 years old and are responsible for 20% of COVID-19 deaths. 40 Furthermore, X-linked recessive TLR7 deficiency has been reported in ~1% of men under 60 years old with lifethreatening COVID-19. 41 Indeed, human TLR7 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells expressing TLR7 are essential for protective innate type I IFN immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract. Finally, in a large study investigating genetic mechanisms of critical illness in COVID-19 by a genome-wide association study in 2244 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from 208 UK intensive care units, low expression of IFNAR2 or high expression of TYK2, are associated with life-threatening disease. 42 These data clearly indicate that signaling by type I IFN and possibly other JAK-STAT pathway components are critical for COVID-19.Type II IFN (IFN-gamma) (figure 1) is secreted by T and NK cells and plays a major role in T cell immunity. 43 Type III IFN (IFN-lambda) is produced by epithelial cells at the local level and may function as an entry barrier for several viruses. IFN-lambda utilizes a distinct receptor system (IL-28R or IFN-lambda receptor alpha and IL-10 receptor beta, coupled also to JAK1 and TYK2, respectively). 44 It is possible that defects in induction and action of IFN-lambda are also involved in COVID- 19 .The presence of a very large genome with many nonstructural proteins allows coronaviruses to target many of the proteins of the innate immunity machinery and especially the mechanisms of type I IFN induction and then signaling in target cells. 31 45 This initial insufficient response allows rapid amplification of virus RNA which then reaches a threshold where it may induce the cytokine storm that usually appears 6-8 days after infection.

68,How do medicinal plants contribute to dental health in ancient populations?,"["" presence of the intestinal and oral pathogens, a tooth abscess (Weyrich et al. 2017 ) and consumption of medicinal plants, and fungi with antibacterial, antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory properties in the El Sidrón individual, strongly suggests that these are all linked, particularly since none of the identified plants has any nutritional properties.Samples of dental calculus from the multiperiod site of Al Khiday, in Sudan, were degraded to extract chemical compounds (Buckley et al. 2014 ). These revealed a consistent presence of Cyperus rotundus L., Cyperaceae, a plant that is both edible and has abundant medicinal properties. Interestingly, this site covers the period in which agriculture was introduced and replaced hunting and gathering as the predominant food collection strategy. Yet, the use of C. rotundus continued and, though it is a good source of carbohydrates, the new agricultural plants would have largely replaced this with more easily accessible availability of these essential macronutrients. Among the useful medicinal properties of the tubers of C. rotundus is the ability to inhibit Streptococcus mutans, a leading source of tooth decay (Yu et al. 2007; Khojaste et al. 2018 ). There was an unusually low level of dental caries in the population of Al Khiday, and the broad consumption of C. rotundus may have wittingly, or unwittingly, contributed to this (Buckley et al. 2014 ). The antibacterial properties of the tubers are a consequence of the identified flavonoids and sesquiterpenes, e.g., rotundone (5).The Late Upper Paleolithic site of Taforalt, Grotte des Pigeons, Morocco, is renowned for the serious oral pathologies of virtually all individuals, as well as its abundant remains of starchy plant foods dating to between 15,100 and 14,000 years ago (Humphrey et al. 2014 ). All of the most common plants recovered at the site are rich sources of starchy carbohydrates and the abundance of their remains suggests that consumption of these may have been a cause for the bad state of the inhabitants' teeth. However, another plant that was also abundant on the site is Juniperus phoenicea L., Cupressaceae; while also a source of starchy carbohydrates, it is also rich in the sesquiterpene, thujopsene (6), that has important antifungal, antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Though it did not cure the people of their dental health problems, it is likely that this plant was used to alleviate some of their symptoms (Hardy 2019 Fig. 1 Reconstructed total ion chromatogram of the pyrogram (pyrolysis profile (610°for 10) after thermal desorption (310°for 10 s).

Insert displays a reconstructed total ion chromatogram of the thermal desorption profile (reproduced from Hardy et al. 2012) More broadly, a study of a small number of Paleolithic sites that have significant plant assemblages demonstrated consistently that the wide variety of species present cannot be explained solely as food (Hardy 2019) . Only plant remains that could be identified to species level were included in the study, and these were divided into three categories: plants that were edible with no significant medicinal properties, plants that had both edible and medicinal properties, and plants that had only medicinal properties (and could also be poisonous). An analysis of the plant remains from the archeological contexts of five Paleolithic sites (Gesher Benot Ya'aqov (GBY) 780,000 years ago, Kebara, 60-48,000 years ago, Ghar e Boof, 33-30,000 years ago, Ohalo II 23-19,000 years ago, Abu Hureyra, 31-9000 years ago, Netiv Hagdud, 11,000-10,000 years ago, Atlit Yam, 10,500-8000 years ago) has shown that there is a far higher proportion of plants containing important medicinal properties than would be present in a natural distribution (Fig. 2 ). An example is the milk thistle, Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn., Asteraceae, renowned for its use today to treat liver problems, and present at three sites (GBY, Ohalo II, Atlit Yam) (Fig. 3) .

239,How does the variability in sensitivity and specificity values affect the results in Fig 3?,"[' test in question may cross-react with other flaviviruses [30] , or have lower specificity in those who have been vaccinated against them [31] . The elicited distributions for sensitivity and specificity are used here to illustrate the current method and are not conclusive in terms of the performance of the test in question. Also, the belief distributions for other diagnostic tests and other settings will vary.The beliefs of the three experts were summarized as a single distribution using linear pooling [32] , and a smooth distribution between 0 and 1 was fitted to the result. Both beta and logistic-normal distribution families were used: each has two parameters, which were fitted by the method of moments [33] . The beta distribution was used for the estimation of the force of infection.More broadly, some models for sensitivity and specificity are unidentifiable [34, 35] , i.e. not all the parameters can be estimated independently. For the current purpose, the estimated force of infection is evidently strongly associated with the sensitivity and specificity. Although posterior likelihoods of sensitivity, specificity and force of infection could be obtained from a formally consistent Bayesian model, the identifiability of such a model would need to be demonstrated. Our interest here is in information on sensitivity and specificity as inputs, not outputs. Hence, we have not referred to the elicited beliefs for sensitivity and specificity as ""priors"". Although these beliefs are used in Monte Carlo simulation, posterior likelihoods are not obtained for them. Rather, values are repeatedly sampled from the fitted beta distributions of sensitivity and specificity, then MCMC estimation is done based on those values.Credible intervals for a parameter are estimated as quantiles of samples drawn, via MCMC, from its Bayesian posterior distribution. Confidence intervals (as opposed to credible intervals) are quoted from frequentist analyses which were carried out for comparison.We use the ""rjags"" package in R (version 3.6.3; The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). This package requires a separate installation of the JAGS package [36] . R code is provided in S2-S4 Files. For the analysis of the Colombo survey, for each value of sensitivity and specificity used, a burn-in of 1,000 iterations was used, with estimates of the force of infection based on 50,000 iterations thinned by 10 (i.e. keeping every 10th result). For the analysis of the repeated surveys in Medellin, the following was done separately for sensitivity and specificity: 2,000 draws were made from the fitted beta distribution then, for each draw, there was a burn-in of 2,000 and the force of infection was estimated from 5,000 iterations thinned by 50. This was done separately for three scenarios): i) with sensitivity varying while holding specificity at 100%, ii) the reverse, and iii) with both parameters varying. Hence the distribution of the force of infection was estimated from 20,000 values. Assessment of convergence was done visually. For all MCMC models, the point estimate is taken to be the median of the iterative values and the 95% credible interval is from the 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles.This Medellin study obtained ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of the University of Antioquia (reference 11-5-362) and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI, reference 2011-011). Data were made available without identifying information. Data from the Colombo study are included from a table in the previously published report [14] .For the dengue study in Colombo [14] , Fig 2 shows the fitted proportions of seropositive by age. Values of 85% sensitivity or specificity have been chosen to illustrate the method rather than on the basis of expert opinion or of comparison against a gold standard. However, they are in the range found for other dengue IgG ELISAs [37, 38] . As expected, imperfect sensitivity implies higher seroprevalence, and imperfect specificity the reverse. The consequences of other values of sensitivity and specificity are shown in Fig 3. The confidence bands reflect [14] .

In March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) determined that COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic [1] . This crisis has profoundly affected all aspects of the society, including the psychological well-being of people [2] . Previous studies have revealed psychological impact of COVID-19 on anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality depending on demographic factors and preexisting psychiatric illnesses [3, 4] .Chronic medical comorbidity might play a role in the psychological impact of COVID-19. Patients with chronic medical diseases are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19. They also have higher risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 infection-related complications with poorer prognosis than healthy controls [5] . They also have great fears that a collapse of the healthcare system by COVID-19 may prevent them from receiving appropriate and timely treatment [6] .Likewise, patients undergoing dialysis can have psychological distress during this outbreak. It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with depression and anxiety, making patients more vulnerable to COVID-19-related stress [7] [8] [9] . Moreover, patients with CKD have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection-related complications and poorer prognosis including higher risks of hospitalization, intensive unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death [10, 11] .In addition, difference in dialysis modalities can affect the psychological impact of COVID-19 on dialysis patients [12] . For example, patients undergoing hemodialysis are highly dependent on medical institutions. They have to stay in the dialysis center for four hours three times weekly, lying in bed next to each other. Most dialysis centers perform standard precautions for infection control. Droplet-mediated viral infections can spread widely when patients undergo hemodialysis. If one patient in the dialysis center is diagnosed with COVID-19, all members of the dialysis center might have to be isolated. Thus, the Korean Society of Nephrology made a policy allowing only patients with body temperatures of less than 37.5˚C without symptoms of COVID-19 to enter the dialysis center [13] . As a result, mild symptoms can delay hemodialysis until the patient is proven to be negative for COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. In contrast, patients undergoing PD usually visit the hospital once a month unless they have special problems because they are trained to perform PD on their own at home. In terms of receiving dialysis, HD patients are more dependent on medical institutions while PD patients play an important role in dialysis themselves.In this study, we aimed to investigate COVID-19-related psychological stress experienced by dialysis patients and differences in concerns about COVID-19 between HD and PD patients. End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients were defined as those who had kidney function less than 15ml/min/1.73m 2 classified by CKD grade 5 who needed kidney replacement therapy such as kidney transplantation or dialysis. Our participants were patients with ESKD undergoing dialysis. They decided their dialysis modalities after receiving balanced information [14] .We hypothesized that patients with dialysis would show severe psychological distress and concerns related to COVID-19 and that the dialysis modality would affect the psychological impact of COVID-19.This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted at Soonchunhyang University Hospital Cheonan. The survey was conducted from August 2020 to September 2020 when monthly number of COVID-19 diagnosis cases had reached an all-time high since COVID-19 was found in Korea (3,865 cases in August and 5,642 cases in September). The Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of Soonchunhyang University Hospital Cheonan approved this study (IRB number: 2020-07-029). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrollment in this study.There were 224 outpatients undergoing both HD and PD in our artificial kidney center. Artificial kidney center doctors verbally explained this study and gave information about this study to potential participants. Among potential participants, those aged from 18 to 90 years with cognitive ability to respond to the questionnaire were included in this study. Patients with hospitalization within three months or those presenting with acute illness were excluded (Fig 1) . We reviewed medical records and analyzed laboratory data to assess whether dialysis was performed adequately.

261,"How does the backbone bond lengths and angles in an unconstrained MD simulation affect the (φ,ψ) space for a residue in the MolProbity Ramachandran map?","[' . 50,000 snapshots taken at 20 ps interval was available. We calculated the (φ,ψ) values at every snapshot for all the residues and classified them using MolProbity as previously described. Fig. 3(a) shows the percent of snapshots at which the residues were having outlier (φ,ψ) values. We see that for 222 out of 253 residues the percent of outlier conformations was non-zero, indicating that protein could adopt varying (φ,ψ) conformations during its motions. Also, in all the 222 residues, (φ,ψ) move from acceptable regions, which are of low energy to outlier regions, which are of apparent high energy. Fig. 3(b) shows the distribution of (φ,ψ) values of Lys 83 in the PKA MD trajectory on the MolProbity Ramachandran map. Apart from certain (φ,ψ) values falling in outlier regions of the map, we also see a huge variation in the (φ,ψ) values being accessed by the residue; there are a large number of observations with φ < 0 as well as φ > 0 , which are separated by inaccessible (φ,ψ) region. Prior studies on ultra-high-resolution peptide and protein structures have shown that the (φ,ψ) steric space is dramatically altered by subtle variations in backbone bond lengths and angles (Ravikumar et al., 2019) . Such changes in bond geometry could occur due to small-scale vibrational motions in the protein, which could make outlier (φ,ψ) conformations accessible to the residue. In other words, by modulating the bond lengths and angles within acceptable limits, the protein could lower the overall energy of an outlier (φ,ψ) conformation, thereby making it accessible. The MD trajectory of the mouse PKA could not be utilized to test this hypothesis since it was performed at 2 fs timestep, whereas studying bond vibrations requires simulations performed at 1 fs timescale or lower. Hence we performed MD simulations on five ultra-high-resolution (<0.8 Å) protein crystal structures at 1 fs timestep with constraints on bond lengths and angles removed so that changes in bond lengths and angles could be sampled (see Materials and Methods for details on the five proteins and the MD protocols used). From these MD trajectories we generated the bond geometry-specific (φ,ψ) steric maps for every residue in every snapshot of the simulation (as shown in Fig. 1 ).Before generating the bond geometry-specific steric maps from the MD trajectory, we first studied the distribution of backbone bond lengths and angles of all residues during the unconstrained 1-fs timestep simulation (see Methods for the list of bond parameters measured). We compared the mean, minimum and maximum values observed during MD to the standard, ideal values obtained from small-molecule peptide structures (Engh and Huber, 2012) . The maximum and minimum of the ideal geometry were defined as values which are þ5σ and -5σ away from the mean. All the distributions for the MD trajectory of Hen egg-white lysozyme (PDB code: 2VB1) are shown in Fig. 4 . The bond length and angle distributions for the remaining four proteins are shown in Supplementary Figs. 1-4. In almost all the bond parameters, the mean value observed from dynamics is very close to the mean values from static structures. Also, there are very few cases where the bond parameter values go beyond the maximum or minimum of ideal geometry range. It is to be noted that, despite the bond parameter distributions being obtained from dynamics simulations with no constraints on the bond lengths and angles, they are highly consistent with Engh & Huber values, which are obtained purely from static small molecule structures (Engh and Huber, 2012) . This validates the stereochemical accuracy of the unconstrained MD simulations. In order to ensure the robustness of these observations against the influence of force field used, we also simulated the lysozyme structure using OPLS-all-atom force field using the same MD protocol (Robertson et al., 2015) . The bond geometry distribution is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 . Here too we see for most of the parameters, the mean values from the simulation is very close to ideal values despite the removal of constraints.In the previous section, we have shown that there are variations in backbone bond parameters within acceptable limits of ideal peptide geometry during the simulation. Prior studies have also shown that such changes affect the extent of steric clash-free regions in (φ,ψ) steric map for a given residue (Ravikumar et al., 2019) . These steric clash-free regions depict the accessible (φ,ψ) space for the residue. Here, we wanted to see the effect of such subtle changes in']","The backbone bond lengths and angles in an unconstrained MD simulation affect the (φ,ψ) space for a residue in the MolProbity Ramachandran map by altering the extent of steric clash-free regions, which depict the accessible (φ,ψ) space for the residue.","In an unconstrained MD simulation, alterations in the backbone bond lengths and angles can affect the (φ,ψ) space for a residue in the MolProbity Ramachandran map.

After incubation for 24 h, A549 cells were trypsinized and harvested, then stained intracellular kit for Ki-67 (eBioscience) and tested by flow cytometry. Cell proliferation ability was also measured by the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Dingguo) following the instructions. Cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates (2 Â 10 3 cells/well) in the different treated medium. Twenty-four hours later, 10 μl CCK-8 solution was added to each well and then incubated at 37 C for another 1-2 h. The absorbance at 450 nm (OD450) was recorded using a microplate reader.Apoptotic A549 cells were detected by FITC conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (Annexin V FITC Apoptosis Detect Kit; 556 547, BD) via flow cytometry. The lysates of A549 were prepared, and Western blot used to detect the apoptosis-associated protein, including cleaved-Caspase3 and Bax.A wound scratch assay was used to determine migratory ability. Confluent monolayers of cultured A549 were scratched with the tip of a p-200 pipette. The cells were rinsed three times with PBS and afterwards incubated in the presence of medium alone or C5a, C5aRA, or their combination (IL-1β, IL-1RA, or their combination). Images of the wound scratches were captured each time at 0, 24, 36 and 48 h. The remaining gap between migrating A549 was measured with Image J and expressed as a percentage of the initial scratched area.A transwell chemotaxis assay was used to determine the invasion ability. Approximately 5 Â 10 4 cells in serum-free medium were seeded into the 24-well Matrigel matrixcoated (Corning) upper chambers, and 500 μl 10% FBS medium with different treatments (C5a, C5aRA, or their combination; IL-1β, IL-1RA, or their combination) were placed in the lower chambers. Over a time period of 24 h, non-invaded cells were wiped off by applying a cotton swab, whereas cells invaded into the lower chambers were fixed and stained using 0.1% crystal violet. Five fields were chosen at random for statistical analysis. Adhesion A549 cells were cultured in the presence of serum-free medium alone, C5a, C5aRA, or C5a + C5aRA (IL-1β, IL-1RA, or IL-1β+IL-1RA). After 24 h, the expression of the I-CAM (353 113, Biolegend) in A549 cells was determined by flow cytometry. In the adhesion assay, 10 6 PMCs were seeded in 12-well plates and grown to 90% confluence. Pretreated A549 cells were trypsinized and labeled by CFSE (556547, Biolegend), and then seeded into the washed PMC monolayers for 24 h. Finally, nonadherent A549 cells were removed by washing. Total adherent cells containing A549 cells and PMCs were trypsinized and analyzed by flow cytometry.Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) A549 cells were cultured in the presence of serum-free medium alone, C5a, C5aRA, or C5a + C5aRA (IL-1β, IL-1RA, or IL-1β+IL-1RA).

Architectures such as VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) and ResNet (He et al. 2015a) for image classification and Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) and SSD (Liu et al. 2016 ) for object detection have proven to provide good accuracy at resonable inference time.CV is utilized for infrastructure inspection in many application domains. The typical challenges addressed with CV in this area are cases where large amounts of physical objects are to be inspected and they are geographically remote and / or dispersed. Selected research articles are presented in the following and summarized in Table 1. A major application area is road surface inspection and maintenance. Roads in bad condition can ultimately result in more accidents and higher costs (Baladi et al. 2017; Gleave et al. 2014) . Thus, CV is utilized to automatically assess road surface condition and derive necessary maintenance actions. Over the last years this became possible without expensive, specialized hardware (compare, e.g., Quintana et al. 2016) . Chatterjee et al. (2018) show how machine learning-based CV can be used to detect road surface cracks and develop a ''vision-based DSS for crack detection''. They offer first insights into a nascent design theory for the application case of road crack detection on the basis of images.Not only roads, but also railways need to be inspected periodically to ensure safe transports. Wei et al. (2019) employ a Faster R-CNN to detect defects of railway track fasteners. Gibert et al. (2017) propose a CNN-based multitask learning approach that detects railway track fasteners and crossties and classifies the state of these components.Wind turbine blades are another physical object of interest for CV-based infrastructure inspection. Akhloufi and Benmesbah (2014) present a CV approach to identify ice accreation on wind turbine blades. Ice accreation can require a maintenance action since it can cause malfunction and premature wear and is a safety hazard for nearby people and infrastructure like roads and powerlines. Shihavuddin et al. (2019) show how faults like leading edge erosion can be detected with a Faster R-CNN on wind turbine blades.In this work, we are particularly interested in CV solutions for power line inspection relying on UAV images. From a component-based view, power line inspection can be divided into four major categories: towers or poles, insulators, conductors, and fittings (Liu et al. 2020) . Each of these categories contains several subcomponents (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) that typically vary in size, kind, and material according to the voltage level. For instance, some part of a distribution network with low voltage might have wooden poles, small standing insulators, and a single, relatively thin conductor. On the other hand, transmission networks usually have lattice steel towers, large suspending insulators, and thicker conductors. Several studies have been published that utilize various potential platforms (e.g., helicopter, satellite, and UAV) to collect different data types (e.g., optical images, laser scanner data, thermal images, and synthetic aperture radar images) and analyzed these (Matikainen et al. 2016) . The vision-based approach -with image data from the visible spectrum captured by UAVs and automatically analyzed through image processing capabilities -has gained the most attention and traction in the power line inspection research domain (Liu et al. 2020) . With a few exceptions, automated vision-based power line inspection based on UAV-captured images requires two inherently related tasks (Liu et al. 2020) : component detection and localization as well as fault diagnosis. The exceptions relate to objects such as bird nests, whose detection already represents a fault. Previous research applying image processing for the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs is numerous (Mirallès et al. 2014) . Liu et al. (2020) identify several characteristics and shortcomings of previous studies using UAV-captured images in their exhaustive literature review. Most studies in the field of vision-based inspection of power lines focus on the insulator and its faults (Liu et al. 2020 ) -mainly missing caps (e.g., Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019; Zhai et al. 2018 ) -while little attention has been paid to other components. The safety pin that prevents other components from loosening and falling is the smallest object in the power line and has, despite its importance, received little attention and has only been regarded in fault diagnosis but not in the detection step. Finally, both Liu et al. (2020) and Nguyen et al. (2018) conclude that the mediocre performance of task-specific approaches presented in the vast majority of studies has been superseded by DL approaches that have improved""]","DL approaches have improved the performance of power line inspection using UAV-captured images.

[70] [71] [72] [73] Thus, for this very large group of diseases with increasing prevalence (0.4-0.7/1000, 5 times higher than chronic myeloid leukemia induced by the BCR-Abelson kinase (ABL) fusion protein) the cause is persistent activation of JAK2 in clonal HSCs, which gives a major advantage to progenitors of red blood cells, platelets and granulocytes, leading to clonal expansion of these lineages in the absence of cytokines.In the same time with the identification of JAK2 V617F it was shown that homologous mutations activate constitutively JAK1 (V658F) and TYK2 (V678F) 66 and these and other activating mutations were identified in T-acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL), in B-ALL and several other conditions. 74 75 Overall, these findings provided an impetus to search for potent inhibitors of JAKs.The second reason why JAKs became prime targets for the pharmaceutical industry is represented by excessive activation of cytokines and their receptors in autoimmune diseases. The prime targets were members of the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21 and especially the two JAK proteins associated with subunits of this group, namely JAK1 and JAK3. 76 Inhibitors were thus seeked that could inhibit JAK1 and JAK3, or only JAK3. Such inhibitors were discovered and it was found that only inhibiting JAK3 exerts a much weaker effect than inhibiting JAK1 and JAK3, implying that JAK1 is the dominant JAK, 77 and that JAK3 needs to be present in the complex, as a scaffold, but its catalytic activity is not as crucial as that of JAK1. 77 78 Indeed, absence of JAK3 has a blocking effect while inhibiting the kinase domain only exerts a minor effect. 77 79 More recently, increased interest in JAKi strategies arose for the need of new treatments for pathological inflammatory conditions like hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) where overactive T cells and macrophages secrete numerous proinflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18 and TNF-α, involving the JAK-STAT pathway. 80 Samewise in COVID-19, the JAK-STAT pathway is implicated in complement hyperactivation in SARS-CoV-2-infected respiratory epithelial cells 81 and in the activation of CD4 + and CD8 + positive T cells, NK cells and monocytes which cooperate with elevated levels of IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-17. Indeed, very high levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-α and G-CSF were described in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care. 82 Furthermore, JAK-STAT activation promotes senescence of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, which amplifies inflammation. 83 Therefore, JAKi, and especially JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, were suggested as a potential therapy against systemic inflammation in COVID-19 84 because treatment with a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor to prevent lung injury in severe COVID-19 would be able to reduce cytokine action more effectively than blocking one cytokine at a time (like IL-6. 85 The major strategy used for obtaining kinase inhibitors is to obtain compounds that prevent ATP entrance in the ATP binding pocket. ATP is obligatory as a source of phosphate for catalysis. The small molecule inhibitor may bind and compete with ATP, or may bind to close-by sites or distant sites that allosterically prevent ATP binding to the ATP pocket. The kinase inhibitors may bind to active kinases and inhibit them (type I) or may bind to the inactive kinase, and block the transition to active kinase (type II). 86 The very well-known kinase inhibitor imatinib inhibits the Abelson kinase (ABL), PDGF receptor and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases. Imatinib binds to kinases when they are inactive (type II), thus preventing activation. All current JAKi used in the clinics so far are type I inhibitors, and they only recognize and bind kinase domain of JAKs in their active conformation. This is on one hand a limitation, as prebinding activation is a prerequisite for binding, hence pathological signaling occurs at a certain point, but on the other hand the']","The JAK-STAT pathway is implicated in complement hyperactivation in SARS-CoV-2-infected respiratory epithelial cells and in the activation of CD4 + and CD8 + positive T cells, NK cells and monocytes which cooperate with elevated levels of IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-17.

237,"What evaluation metrics were used for fault diagnosis in the safetypins class, and how were the models trained and tested?","["" the fault diagnosis of the safetypins. To compare and benchmark the fault diagnosis, we chose the well-known VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) architecture. In both tasks, image augmentation was used to improve the generalization of the models. For object detection the brightness of the images was randomly adjusted. For the classification task, where cropped images of safetypins were classified, we applied horizontal and vertical flipping, random brightness adjustment, width as well as height range shifting, and random image blurring.The component detectors were implemented using the Tensorflow 3 DL framework 4 (Abadi et al. 2015) with models pretrained on the MS COCO dataset (Lin et al. 2014) . The image classifiers were realized using the Keras DL library 5 (Chollet et al. 2015) which provides image classification models pretrained on the ILSVRC dataset (Russakovsky et al. 2015) .For the evaluation of DF1-DF3 and DP1 and DP2 respectively, we conducted both an artificial evaluation to closely assess the pipeline's efficacy and efficiency as well as a naturalistic evaluation to generally judge the design's acceptance and usefulness. In accordance, the evaluation episodes were guided by the questions below: Artificial evaluation of the model component (EE I.I) The efficiency evaluation of the proposed pipelines required two considerations. First, the pipeline's ability to detect the chosen components needed to be evaluated. Second, the accuracy of the fault diagnosis -which we performed for detected safetypins -had to be assessed.Evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the detection task in terms of average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP) (Rafael Padilla and da Silva 2020), we compared our proposed MSCD to the SSCD pipeline. As we were working with our own proprietary dataset DS Ro , the available images were split into a training set comprising 80% of the data, with the remaining 20% used for the evaluation set. To increase the evaluation's validity, images captured at one tower were held out from the random split and solely utilized for the evaluation dataset, while maintaining the split ratio. This image-level split was kept consistent across the derived datasets DS1 Co and DS2 Fi . The SSCD pipeline was fine-tuned to detect the respective component classes using the DS Ro dataset. Accordingly, both detection stages of the MSCD pipeline were fine-tuned on DS1 Co and DS2 Fi respectively. All models were trained using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer with 0.0003 (Faster R-CNN) and 0.001 (SSD) initial learning rate respectively, 0.9 momentum, and batch size 64. We determined the models by using early stopping on the validation loss with a patience of 100 for all models. The testing results of the different pipelines using the different architectures are shown in Fig. 6 . The performance for the safetypin class is disclosed in terms of inter pipeline performance for both the SSCD and the MSCD pipeline as well as the intra pipeline performance for solely the MSCD pipeline.We evaluated the fault diagnosis task performed for the safetypins class in terms of weighted precision, weighted recall, and weighted F 1 -score (Pedregosa et al. 2011) to account for class imbalance. We applied a 3-fold cross validated grid-search to identify the optimal combination of parameters. We chose to account for the following parameter: unfrozen convolutional layers, dense layer size, optimizer and its respective learning rate, dropout rate, and batch size. The images in dataset DS3 Pi were shuffled, a hold out set containing 10% of the images was retained and the remaining images were split into 3 folds. Consequently, for each grid search configuration three models were trained with early stopping with patience 30. The best resulting model of the Resnet and VGG16 model were harnessed to be evaluated on the retained hold out set. The results of the evaluation of the cropped safetypin classification task based on the test set are shown in Table 6 . All details on the machine learning steps and choices are depicted within Sect.

195,"What factors are associated with MERS-CoV illness in humans in Saudi Arabia during March-November 2014, according to the study?","['Risk Factors for Primary Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Illness in Humans, Saudi Arabia, 2014\nRisk factors for primary Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) illness in humans are incompletely understood. We identified all primary MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia during March-November 2014 by excluding those with history of exposure to other cases of MERS-CoV or acute respiratory illness of unknown cause or exposure to healthcare settings within 14 days before illness onset. Using a case-control design, we assessed differences in underlying medical conditions and environmental exposures among primary case-patients and 2-4 controls matched by age, sex, and neighborhood. Using multivariable analysis, we found that direct exposure to dromedary camels during the 2 weeks before illness onset, as well as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and smoking, were each independently associated with MERS-CoV illness. Further investigation is needed to better understand animal-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.M iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly recognized respiratory pathogen first identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia in June 2012 (1) . MERS-CoV causes acute respiratory disease that has a high case-fatality rate (2) . All cases have been linked to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula; >85% of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia (2) . Outbreaks of MERS-CoV have been associated primarily with transmission in healthcare settings (3) (4) (5) . Transmission among household contacts of case-patients has been documented (6) , but sustained human-to-human transmission has not (7) . Low-level infections with MERS-CoV have been reported, but seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in the general population in Saudi Arabia is low (8) . Strategies to prevent and control infection are recommended to limit secondary transmission in healthcare settings and among household contacts (9, 10) . MERS-CoV cases continue to be reported in Saudi Arabia in healthcare settings and in the community (2) .Animals have been suspected as a source of primary infection since early in the emergence of MERS-CoV, particularly given the similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, a zoonosis known to cause human respiratory disease, often severe, with sustained human-tohuman transmission and amplification in healthcare settings (11) . Persons with early cases of MERS-CoV infection were observed to have had exposure to dromedary camels (henceforth dromedaries), and subsequent serologic studies from the Arabian Peninsula confirmed high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in dromedaries (12) (13) (14) . Other studies have detected partial genome sequences of MERS-CoV from dromedary specimens (15) (16) (17) , and more recently infectious MERS-CoV has been isolated from dromedaries (16, (18) (19) (20) (21) . Additionally, a recent report provided virologic and serologic evidence of transmission of MERS-CoV from a sick dromedary to a human in Saudi Arabia (19) .Despite these reports, risk factors for primary illness with MERS-CoV (i.e., cases in persons without apparent exposure to other infected persons) are not well understood.No risk factors for primary transmission of MERS-CoV to humans have been confirmed by epidemiologic studies, including a link with exposure to dromedaries or any other animal species. We conducted a case-control study to assess exposures in primary cases and to identify risk factors associated with primary MERS-CoV illness in humans.In Saudi Arabia, all laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases are reported to the Ministry of Health (MoH) and routinely investigated to assess preillness exposures. All cases reported during March 16-November 13, 2014, were screened for inclusion. For cases reported before May 13, 2014, a confirmed case was defined as illness in any person hospitalized with bilateral pneumonia and laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection on the basis of a positive real-time reverse transcription PCR targeting 2 genes: the upstream of E gene and the open reading frame 1a gene (22) . The case definition was revised on May 13, after which a confirmed case was defined as laboratory confirmation and any 1 of the following 4 clinical definitions: 1) fever and community-acquired pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome based on clinical or radiologic evidence; 2) healthcare-associated pneumonia based on clinical and radiologic evidence in a hospitalized person; 3a) acute febrile (>38°C) illness, b) body aches, headache, diarrhea, or nausea/vomiting, with or without respiratory symptoms, and c) unexplained le']","Direct exposure to dromedary camels, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and smoking were each independently associated with MERS-CoV illness.","According to the study conducted in Saudi Arabia during March-November 2014, the factors associated with MERS-CoV illness in humans were direct exposure to dromedary camels during the 2 weeks before illness onset, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and smoking.","What factors are associated with MERS-CoV illness in humans in Saudi Arabia during March-November 2014, according to the study? ->: According to the study conducted in Saudi Arabia during March-November 2014, the factors associated with MERS-CoV illness in humans were direct exposure to dromedary camels during the 2 weeks before illness onset, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and smoking.","

124,Why measure parent and child skin carotenoids in the study on parental participation in a weight management program?,"[""Changes in Parent and Child Skin Carotenoids, Weight, and Dietary Behaviors over Parental Weight Management\nAdult obesity rates have increased over the past three decades [1, 2] , with half of all United States (US) adults pursuing some form of weight loss, often through medical weight management programs (WMPs) [3, 4] . Given that parental obesity is the strongest risk factor for childhood obesity, these children are three-times more likely to develop obesity and future comorbidities extending into adulthood, as well as a shortened life expectancy [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Yet, we know very little about how parental participation in adult medical WMPs affects children's dietary behaviors [13] . Despite convincing evidence that parental participation in children's medical WMPs has positive effects on both child and parent behaviors and weight [14] [15] [16] [17] , there is a paucity of data on whether these same trends emerge when parents are the identified patient in these programs, and the child is not the focus. This is an important limitation with significant implications given that 50% of US adults are attempting weight loss many with children living with them who are at risk of obesity. Thus, understanding the influence of parental participation in medical WMPs on children's dietary behaviors is essential information needed before targeted interventions can be designed to reach a subgroup of parent-child dyads for which there are currently no tested interventions, and for children at high risk of having obesity.Prior research conducted with children of parents in adult medical WMPs is predominately cross-sectional [13, [18] [19] [20] [21] , retrospective [22, 23] , and isolated to parent-only perspectives [13, 18, 20] . Prospective assessments of dyads' objectively measured dietary behaviors are needed to determine short-and long-term effects of parental participation on children. Given that fruit and vegetable intake is part of a healthy diet and is a target in WMPs, finding accurate and feasible ways to track fruit and vegetable intake over WMP is necessary. However, obtaining parent and child objective measures of diet is time-and resource-intensive. One innovative, non-invasive way is through validated resonance Raman spectroscopy to measure carotenoid status in skin as a biomarker of fruit/vegetable intake [24, 25] . Carotenoids are phytochemicals present in many fruits and vegetables that are distributed in human tissues after consumption. Assessment of carotenoid status has been validated for use as an indicator of dietary intake [26] . Objective measures of skin carotenoids consistently demonstrate moderate to strong correlations with total serum or plasma carotenoids, and are positively associated with intake of fruits and vegetables as assessed by food frequency questionnaires and automated multiple-pass 24-h daily recalls among children ≥5 years-old [26] [27] [28] [29] . This method accounts for greater accuracy in reporting, especially from children, who often provide subjective reports for dietary intake [26] [27] [28] [29] .The objective of the study was to determine changes in parent and child fruit and vegetable intake via skin carotenoids and changes in weight (BMI, BMIz) over parental participation in an adult outpatient medical WMP, and associations between parent and child carotenoids and changes in weight, reported fruit and vegetable intake, and family meal frequency and patterns. It was hypothesized that: (1) parents experience significant decreases in BMI and increases in skin carotenoids; (2) parent and child skin carotenoids are correlated at each visit; (3) higher skin carotenoids in parents and children are associated with lower parent BMI and child BMIz at each visit; (4) higher parent and child skin carotenoids are associated with parent and child reports of increased fruit and vegetable intake at each visit; (5) more frequent family meals are associated with higher parent and child skin carotenoids at each visit; and (6) more frequent fast food, delivery, and restaurant/carry out consumption are associated with lower parent and child skin carotenoids at each visit.The study was a part of a larger study about the effects on children from parental participation in an adult medical WMP. The single group, longitudinal design utilized objective and survey assessments from WMP initiation, 3-months (mid-program), and 6-months (program end). Recruitment took place at parents' WMP orientation from November 2018 to March 2020, in which every eligible parent-child dyad was invited to participate.

111,What are the advantages of COVIDSum compared to other models and how does it use linguistic knowledge to improve performance?,"['We randomly select 200 samples from the test set of CORD-19 dataset and compare the summaries generated by our proposed COV-IDSum and the summaries generated by other abstractive summarization models. We invite eleven expert volunteers to participate in our human evaluation, including three physicians, a fever clinic doctor, and seven trained annotators to rate these samples on a scale of 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good) in terms of the four aspects. Annotators are blind to the Table 9 Performance of different summarization methods on CORD-19 test set. correspondences of the model types to the generated summaries. The blinding was achieved by restoring the original orders of summaries generated by different models and shuffling them before human evaluators. After human evaluation, the results are reorganized to their original orders. The average results are listed in Table 12 . For each indicator, the human evaluation results with -symbol are significantly different from COVIDSum using two-tailed paired t-test with p < 0.05. Considering if the annotation process is not even reliable, the annotation results cannot be correct, analysis of Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) should also be included as well as the mean of annotations. In Table 12 , we also present the Fleiss\'s kappas and Krippendorff\'s alphas in the parentheses below the mean scores to vertify the reliability of our human expert evaluation and the agreement between annotators.To be specific, when calculating the Krippendorff\'s alpha, we model the disagreement using the interval diffence function as below:where s i , s j are scores given by annotators.Based on the Fleiss\'s kappas and Krippendorff\'s alphas presented in Table 12 , we believe the annotation process is reliable, and substantial agreement is shared among annotators. Given the fact that our annotators are made up of physicians, clinicians, and trained volunteers whose understandings for biomedical academic papers are diverse, the results of IAA analysis are satisfying. Table 12 shows that our COVIDSum model outperforms the other three abstractive models on all four aspects. As the pointer-generator networks with coverage mechanism is an RNN-based sequence-tosequence summarization model, it lacks the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which leads to its inferior performance in the task of summarizing lengthy scientific papers. The mediocre human evaluation results of the other two BERT-based models also are consistent with the automatic ROUGE metrics represented in Section 5.5. We can attribute the outstanding results of our proposed model to the pre-trained sequence encoder\'s impressive ability to model sequence, the explicit linguistic knowledge (i.e. word co-occurrence graphs), and the highway networks-based feature fusion module.We randomly sampled a paper, Modeling the evolution of COVID-19 via compartmental and particle-based approaches: Application to the Cyprus case, to present a case study for hallucinations in automatically generated abstracts. Table 13 shows the reference abstract and summaries generated by BERTSumAbs, HIBERT, and COVIDSum.As shown in Table 13 , though the abstract generated by BERTSu-mABS is fluent, some hallucinations still occur. For example, the objective of this paper is to ""provide predictions for some scenarios"", instead of ""provide more precise definition"" as stated in predicted summaries. The proposed model is derived for countries like Cyprus, not just ""a given case of Cyprus"". Moreover, BERTSumABS predicts summaries with repetitions, such as the word ""deaths"".The extractive summarization model, HIBERT, provides a most readable predicted abstract. However, the coherence between extracted sentences seems problematic despite the satisfying fluency. We observe that although the order of sentences in the predicted abstract is consistent with their order in the source paper, they are not coherent enough for comprehension.As an abstractive summarization model, our proposed COVIDSum model inevitably generates a few repetitions. The two duplicate adverbs (i.e., ""actually"" and ""reliably"") in a context can be considered as repetitions, but they do not create obstacles for readers to understanding the whole paragraph. More importantly, much fewer hallucinations occur in the abstract generated by our proposed COVIDSum, which implies our A qualitative analysis of hallucinations in summaries (contents written in bold implies hallucinations, and contents written in italic refer to repetition.)Ground-truth We present two different approaches for modeling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both approaches are based on the population classes susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and recovered and allow for an arbitrary number of subgroups with different infection rates and different levels of testing. The first model is derived from a set of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the rates at which population transitions take place among classes. The other is a particle model, which is a specific case of crowd simulation model, in which the disease', 'ERT, PEGASUS-Large and COVIDSum) all achieve performance gains over the above three approaches. BERTSumAbs is the sequence-to-sequence baseline with BERT as encoder and Transformer as decoder, the prior knowledge injected during the pre-training process ensures its performance improvements. HIBERT pre-trains a hierarchical encoder and applies it in an extractive summarization model. However, since training of HIBERT demands the manual labels of target sentences, the quality of labels limits its capability. By incorporating linguistic knowledge, the word co-occurrence relationships specifically, to the summarization model, our proposed COVIDSum achieves the highest ROUGE scores comparing with the other comparing summarization methods. PEGASUS-Large losses its competence in the task of summarizing secientific documents. The PEGASUS-Large is a general-domain pre-trained model rather than a domain-specific one. The COVIDSum model, enhanced with SciBERT, shows high suitability for scientific summarization in the COVID-19 domain.Also, our proposed SciBERTbased COVIDSum model shows performance advantages over the general-domain BART for scientific summarization in the COVID-19 domain.Furthermore, to examine the significance of improvement, we conduct statistical hypothesis testing. Table 10 presents the results of the two-tailed paired t-test (with p < 0.05) comparing the COVIDSum with other abstractive summarization models including PGN + Cov, BERT-SumABS, HIBERT, and PEGASUS-Large. The Null hypothesis (H_0) is that the difference of means on ROUGE-2 F1 measure of two methods equals zero. Alternative hypothesis (H_1) is that the difference of means on ROUGE-2 F1 measure of two methods do not equal zero.As shown in Table 10 , the improvements on ROUGE-2 F1 score of our COVIDSum are statistically significant, compared to other neural abstractive approaches.Since it is difficult to determine whether each component in the COVIDSum contributes to the performance improvements, we compare our full model with three ablated variants. We conduct an ablation study by removing several modules while remaining the rest of the COVIDSum architecture unaltered. We report the following three typical ablation models:w/o (Graph Encoder & Feature Fusion): removing both the graph encoder and the feature fusion module, and the original COVIDSum degrades into a standard sequence-to-sequence model with a pre-trained encoder and a Transformer decoder; w/o Feature Fusion: removing feature fusion module and simply adding the features from two encoders together; w/o Pre-training: using a vanilla Transformer encoder without pre-training instead of the variant of a pre-trained BERT.From Table 11 , we observe that the overall performance on ROUGE metrics of COVIDSum model is rather comparative, but the ROUGE-2 score drops significantly when the pre-trained sequence encoder is substituted with a non-pre-trained one. This observation suggests that the pre-training process enables the Transformer encoder to capture the semantic features of input sequences, and further boosts the performance of COVIDSum. Compared to COVIDSum model, performance of the model w/o (Graph Encoder & Feature Fusion) declines dramatically. We deem that word co-occurrences are essential for summarization, and explicitly providing the word co-occurrence features contributes to the performance improvements of COVIDSum. Based on the results in the first, second and fourth rows, we can infer that both the graph encoder which incorporates word co-occurrence features, and the highway networks which fuses features can benefit the COVIDSum model and their contributions can be accumulated. Experimental results indicate that all features, techniques, and modules are effective for COVIDSum to achieve performance gains.The ROUGE metric only measures n-gram overlapping between the generated summary and the ground-truth summary. However, merely evaluating our method with ROUGE is not sufficient to prove its capability. To overcome this limitation, we also perform human expert evaluation with different summarization methods on CORD-19 dataset.We predefine four indicators to evaluate the quality of a generated summary: 1) Informativeness, which indicates how much the salient information of the source documents are remained; 2) Fluency, namely readability, means whether the generated text is grammatically correct and easy to understand; 3) Coherence, which evaluates the logicalness of paragraphs or sentences; 4) Redundancy, which measures the summary should contain few repeated information (higher score in the table indicates lower redundancy).Both the generated summaries and corresponding reference texts are required in our human evaluation settings. Thus, we did not evaluate the ground-truth summaries here, because they have already been used as reference texts to evaluate the generated summaries.']","COVIDSum has several advantages compared to other models, including BERTSumAbs, HIBERT, and PEGASUS-Large. It achieves higher ROUGE scores in scientific summarization in the COVID-19 domain. COVIDSum uses linguistic knowledge, specifically word co-occurrence relationships, to improve performance. The graph encoder in COVIDSum incorporates word co-occurrence features, and the feature fusion module fuses these features to enhance the model's performance.","The advantages of COVIDSum compared to other models include its ability to outperform other abstractive models in terms of ROUGE scores, its incorporation of explicit linguistic knowledge such as word co-occurrence graphs, and the utilization of highway networks for feature fusion.

197,What evidence suggests ancient use of medicinal plants and how did psychotropic plant use develop from it?,"["" and the use of plants as medicine. Six papyri from Egypt, dating to between 2000 BC and 1500 BC (Frey 1985) , display an extensive knowledge with around 160 different medicinal plants identified (Ritner 2000) . Hundreds of thousands of medical texts from Mesopotamia were written mostly on clay tablets in cuneiform and date to the 3rd millennium BC (Robson 2008; Retief and Cilliers 2007) . Medicinal plants are discussed in the Atharvaveda (Bloomfield 1899), an Indian text written around 1200 BC in Sanskrit. The first known Chinese medicine text is the Huangdi Neijing dated to the third century BC (Cavalieri and Rotoli 1997) though Chinese medicine is considered to be at least 4500 years old (Wong and Wu 1932) while the earliest text in Japan is the Ishimpō, a 30-volume text completed in 984 CE (Tamba 1986 ). Early Greek medicine was strongly focused on medicinal plants (Prioreschi 1996) . De Materia Medica, a fivevolume work comprising descriptions of over 600 medicinal plants was written between 50 and 70 CE by Pedanius Dioscorides, a Greek physician in the Roman Army, while the Hippocratic Oath which dates to around 275 CE is still used today (Hulkower 2016) . Medicinal plants, specifically those with anthelmintic or anti-parasite properties, have been identified in several colonial manuscripts including the XVI century Aztec herbal, The Badianus Manuscript (Emmart 1940) . Several of these plants were tested and many were found to correlate with the curative properties described by the Aztec informants (Ortiz de Montellano 1975).Poisons are also likely to have been used in the deep past. Several plants from the Paleolithic assemblages analyzed by Hardy (2019) were poisonous as well as medicinally valuable (Fig. 4) , though it is not possible to determine whether they were used as poisons, medicines, or both since the difference is based on the dosage (Stark 2017) , something that cannot be reproduced from archeological contexts. The only way to identify the probable use of a plant as poison, rather than medicine, is by its context. Traces of Ricinus communis L., Euphorbiaceae (castor oil plant), were detected on a wooden stick similar to those used recently by the Kalahari San as poisons applicators, at the 24.5 ka archeological site of Border Cave in South Africa strongly suggesting it was being used as a poison (d'Errico et al. 2012 ) while traces of Euphorbia tirucalli L, Euphorbiaceae, another poisonous plant, were also found at the site (Borgia 2019). This plant is well known to contain irritant, cytotoxic, and tumorpromoting constituents such as phorbol ester derivatives found in the latex as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (8). The arrowheads and spear points that were developed by ancient modern humans appear in the archeological record from around 70,000-50,000 years ago. They suggest throwing weapons, enabling hunters to kill without being in direct contact with the animal; however, the stone tips were not strong or large enough to kill most animals and poison is likely to have been applied to the stone tips (Borgia 2019).The use of psychotropic plants rich in entheogens or psychoactive substances may have developed out of the evolutionary use of medicinal plants since the physiological pathways to process these compounds are the same as those used for medicinal plants. These pathways are likely to be very ancient and combine taste receptors, tissue barriers, and the bloodbrain barrier (Sullivan and Hagen 2002; Hagen and Tushingham 2019) . However, archeological evidence for psychotropic drug use in the Paleolithic is limited. Currently the earliest potential evidence comes from a 13,000-year-old site in Timor where the remains of betel vine (Areca catechu L., Arecaceae) were found (Hagen and Tushingham 2019) . Redbrown-stained teeth, also demonstrating the use of betel nut, were recovered from sites in the Philippines and Vietnam dated to the 3rd millennium BC (Bronze Age) (Guerra-Doce 2015). The evidence for psychoactive plant use is more abundant in the Neolithic and also the Egyptian New Kingdom (Merlin 2003) with evidence in the form of carbonized remains of the actual plants and also as residual traces inside ceramic pots and impressions in the clay or, in Egypt, also displayed on artifacts (Merlin 2003) . The presence of Cannabis has been identified as hemp imprints on pottery from Taiwan (10,000 years BP) and is present as a raw material (hemp) in early farming contexts in China (Guerra-Doce 2015) but the most common plant is Papaver somniferum L.,"", ' from 6 to 33%, rising significantly at the start of the Neolithic period 11-9000 years ago, suggests more extensive mechanisms for social transmission at this time (Fig. 4) .After the Paleolithic, there is more evidence of both survival with pathologies and, in some exceptional cases, actual remains of medicinal plants. The mummified body of a 4500-year-old man, thought to be around 40-50 years old when he died, was found in 1991 in the Italian Alps (Gaber and Künzel 1998) . Nicknamed Ötzi, he had multiple pathologies, including periodontitis, healed rib fractures, intestinal parasites, and gall stones. He also had some degenerative joint disease, mild osteoarthritis, and a healed broken rib as well as several peri-mortem injuries (Zink et al. 2019 ). Sixty-one tattoos in nineteen groups were found on his body (Samadelli et al. 2015) , all related to known acupuncture points suggesting preventative medicinal measures, while fragments of plants, including the bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, Dennstaedtiaceae (treatment: intestinal parasites), several mosses including Sphagnum imbricatum Hornsch. ex Russow., Sphagnaceae (treatment: wound dressing) and fungi like birch polypore, Piptoporus betulinus (Bull.) P. Karst., Fomitopsidaceae (anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties) were found either as part of his equipment or in his stomach and are thought to have been used as medicines (Zink et al. 2019 ). The very detailed study of this mummified individual has provided a unique insight into the extent of both preventative and curative medicine from the Bronze Age (Fig. 5) .One of the earliest sites in the American continent is Monte Verde, in Chile, that was occupied from at least 18,500-14,500 years ago (Dillehay et al. 2015) . This site has a large assemblage of carbonized plants, of which a significant number, including several species of seaweed, are thought to have been collected for their medicinal properties while the remains of a structure are thought to be a medicinal hut (Dillehay 1997 , Dillehay et al. 2008 , Dillehay et al. 2015 . Traces of the medicinal San Pedro cactus, Echinopsis pachanoi (Britton & Rose) Friedrich & G.D. Rowley, Cactaceae, were found at Guitarrero Cave, Peru, and dated to around 10,000 years ago (8600-5600 BC; Lynch 1980) . Medicinal uses including treatment for ulcers, wounds, inflammation acne, and fortifying hair have been recorded ethnographically (Bussmann and Sharon 2006; Paniagua-Zambrana and Bussmann 2020) , and it also has hallucinogenic properties (Guerra-Doce 2015) due to its high content of mescaline (7), a protoalkaloid of the substituted phenethylamine class. Reinhard et al. (1991) developed the use of pollen extracted from human coprolites to develop studies of paleopharmacology from North and South American archeological sites. The use of pollen as evidence of deliberate plant ingestion is complex, since it occurs as ""rain"" and can be environmental; however, high concentrations are suggested to indicate intentional consumption (Reinhard et al. 1991) . Using this method, several studies of prehistoric and pre-Hispanic populations in the American continent have identified possible ingestion of a range of medicinal plants, sometimes in association with evidence for intestinal parasites. Examples include sites in North America (Reinhard et al. 1991 ) (Ephedra sp., Larrea sp., Salix sp.; Sobolik and Gerick 1992, Ephedra sp., Prosopis sp.), and South America, including Furna do Estrago, Pernambuco State, Brazil (several plants including Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart.) Coville, Fabaceae, or barbatimão) and a range of genera including, Sida sp., Sebastiania sp., and Fevillea sp. (Teixeira-Santos et al. 2015) and Pedra Furada, in the State of Piauí, Brazil, where twelve taxa from genera that include medicinal plants were identified (de Miranda Chaves and Reinhard 2006) . The low levels of the otherwise very common intestinal parasites Ascaris lumbricoides (giant roundworm) and Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) in some South American prehistoric populations have led to the suggestion that this may be due to the use of medicinal plants (Leles et al. 2010) .Some of the earliest texts known concern medical practices']","The evidence for ancient use of medicinal plants includes papyri from Egypt, medical texts from Mesopotamia, Indian texts, Chinese medicine texts, and early Greek medicine. The use of psychotropic plants developed from the evolutionary use of medicinal plants, as they share the same physiological pathways.","The evidence for the ancient use of medicinal plants comes from archeological findings, such as carbonized remains of plants, residual traces inside ceramic pots, and impressions on artifacts.

141,"""What are the effects of H5N1 influenza virus on cats and how do live attenuated vaccines impact the virus in humans?""","['ibody responses elicited by an infection in ferrets generally correlated with those seen in mice, but, as in the mouse model, the antibody responses did not correlate with virus replication. In the ferret model, live attenuated, cold-adapted H6 AI candidate vaccine viruses were attenuated compared to the corresponding wild-type H6 virus. None of the vaccine viruses caused signs of illness in ferrets, nor did they replicate in the lungs. A single intranasal dose of the vaccine viruses elicited serum neutralizing and HAI antibodies in ferrets, and, as in mice, conferred complete protection in the lower respiratory tract following wildtype virus challenge. The levels of neutralizing antibody induced in ferrets by these vaccine viruses did not accurately predict the outcome of challenge with heterologous H6 viruses. The H6 AI viruses generally behaved in a similar fashion in ferrets and in mice, but species-specific differences in the cross-reactive antibody responses were observed.The reconstructed 1918 H1N1 influenza virus replicated to high titers in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following intranasal inoculation [156] . All inoculated ferrets exhibited severe signs of disease that included lethargy, anorexia, sneezing, rhinorrhea, severe weight loss and high fever from day 2 p.i., and two out of three animals succumbed to infection by day 11. Unlike the highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in ferrets, viral replication was not detected in tissues outside the respiratory tract. Necrotizing bronchiolitis, moderate to severe alveolitis and edema were observed in the lungs of infected ferrets on day 3 p.i. The presence of viral antigen in the upper and lower portions of the bronchi, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium and in the hyperplasic epithelium within the alveoli was observed.There are few reports in the literature on influenza infection in cats. In studies conducted by Paniker and Nair in the 1970s [157, 158] , intranasal infection of anesthetized cats with influenza A/Hong/Kong/1968 (H3N2) virus freshly isolated from human cases or laboratory-and egg-adapted isolates did not result in clinical signs of influenza but virus was recovered from pharyngeal secretions, and infection induced HAI antibodies and was transmitted to contact animals. Infected cats did not display clinical signs of influenza. Hinshaw and colleagues [155] later demonstrated that intranasally administered H7N7 and H7N3 AI viruses replicated in the upper respiratory tract of cats without clinical signs of disease, and the cats developed HAI antibodies after infection.There was little interest in influenza infection and immunity in cats until the recent re-emergence of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses in Asia, when it was reported that a number of big cats, namely tigers and leopards in the zoos in Thailand, became infected with HPAI H5N1 viruses, apparently after they were fed infected chicken carcasses [9] . Infection in many of these felids was fatal, and later, anecdotal reports of H5N1 infection in domestic cats in areas where there were outbreaks of H5N1 infection in avian populations contributed to a surge in interest in H5N1 influenza in cats. The pattern of attachment of a human H5N1 influenza virus to respiratory tract tissues of a cat was similar to that seen with human tissue [152] .Experimental infection of European short haired cats with an H5N1 virus isolated from a human in Vietnam in 2004 resulted in clinical disease, virus replication in respiratory and extra-pulmonary tissues, and pathological changes consistent with H5N1 infections in humans [10, 159] . Clinical signs, including significant elevation in body temperature, decreased activity, conjunctivitis and labored breathing were seen in cats experimentally infected intratracheally or by feeding on infected chicks [10] . Similar disease symptoms were observed in sentinel cats that became infected from being housed with cats that had been infected intratracheally. Illness in contact cats became apparent about 3 days later than in the cats infected via the intratracheal route. Peak viral titers in the throat swabs of the intratracheally infected cats were~10 4.5 TCID 50 /ml, whereas the peak titers observed in nasal swabs ranged from 10 2.5 to 10 5.0 TCID 50 /ml [159] . The virus was also recovered from rectal swabs of cats infected by feeding on infected chicks, but the titers of virus in these samples varied widely. In addition, cats infected through feeding had lesions in the intestines. In animals infected intratracheally or by feeding, the virus was also recovered from extra-pulmonary tissues, most often from the brain, liver']","The effects of H5N1 influenza virus on cats include clinical disease, virus replication in respiratory and extra-pulmonary tissues, and pathological changes consistent with H5N1 infections in humans.

The parameters of these two models are tuned using information on COVID-19 from the literature and country-specific data, including the effect of restrictions as they were imposed and lifted. We demonstrate the applicability of both models using data from Cyprus, for which we find that both models yield very similar results, giving confidence in the predictions.The COVID pandemic has seen worldwide outbreaks, resulting in over five million validated cases of infection. This work aims to provide more precise definition for a number of scenarios using two models. First, we used a time dependent infection rate and detection rate as a function of the number of deaths, intubation, and deaths. Second, we derive a model that is suitable for a given case of Cyprus. We show that the model can be used to predict the spread of the disease in Cyprus, where data typically used for modeling the evolution of COVID is too small for a meaningful data driven analysis. HIBERT Mathematical models and numerical simulation can be used as a decision support tool to assist policy-makers, by forecasting the spread of the disease as a function of the lifting of restrictions as well as on the level of testing and contact tracing. The main goal of the study is to examine the forecasting potential of the above models for the short-term evolution of COVID-19, under various conditions related to imposing or lifting measures. One of the key highlights of this study is that, although these models are based on different approaches, they both yield consistent predictions within their corresponding uncertainties. COVIDSumThe COVID pandemic is a new disease but there is not enough understanding on its future evolution. In this study, we use two different models to provide forecasts for the spread and evolution of the disease in Cyprus. Although two models are based on different approaches, they can both yield consistent predictions. First, the classical SIR models are able to accurately reliably describe outbreak for small epidemics, which uses a time-dependent infection rate and detection rate. Next, particle models can be used to simulate the dynamics of the disease outbreaks.proposed model can provide a reliable draft abstract based on the paper contents before researchers write the final abstract. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations support the conclusion that the COVIDSum has overall advantages compared to other models. Moreover, statistical hypothesis tests are conducted for both automatic evaluation and human evaluation, which ensures the improvements of COVIDSum are significant.In this paper, we propose to generate scientific paper summaries related to COVID-19 via a linguistically enriched BioBERT-based summarization model. We first extract salient sentences from source papers and construct word co-occurrence graphs based on the selected sentences. Then we adopt BioBERT and a graph attention network (GAT) based graph encoder to encode the sentences and word co-occurrence graphs respectively, and generate a summary of each scientific paper by fusing the above two encodings using highway networks.

142,What can data-driven approaches identify in terms of evolutionary trends and how can this information be used for designing strategies against future SARS-CoV-2 strains?,"["" has its limitations, most importantly their dependence on the availability of sufficiently large and diverged sequence ensembles. In fact, we observe that a greater number of sequences usually increases the performance of the approach (Fig. 4C and S10). However, it is important to note that the inclusion of more divergent sequences might not always be the best strategy as the model might capture constraints that are not relevant for the specific SARS-CoV-2 context. This trade-off will be explored in future work.Our approach can be extended in several ways. One is to include how different domains might constrain the variability of other domains. However, according to our analysis in the previous section, inter-domain epistasis seems to play only a minor role, even if more sequence data might be needed to better estimate the influence of inter-domain or inter-protein epistasis. Another is to model constraints due to specific virus-host interaction, which is currently out of our scope, as we do not consider host sequences in the MSAs. Indeed, we observe the correlation of experimental binding to ACE2 and our predictions (Pearson's r = 0.27) can be fully explained through the protein expression (Pearson's r partial correlation controlled by expression = -0.02). In an attempt to explore this issue, we built co-alignments of receptor-binding domains with homologs of ACE2 present in the hosts of other coronaviruses. Since the binding mechanism between RBD and ACE2 homologs is present only in sarbecoviruses, the resulting co-alignment of RBD and ACE2 homologs contains only 7 effective sequences (non-redundant sequences at 80% identity, cf. Materials and Methods), a number being insufficient to capture the complex virus-host interactions.Predicting evolution is an undoubtedly daunting task (43, 44) . While there is little, if any, hope to predict specific future evolutionary events, we have shown that data-driven approaches capturing statistical patterns in sequence data can effectively identify more general evolutionary trends, such as which positions are more likely to mutate and represent a concern to current therapeutic interventions. In this sense, our work is a step forward to a more precise characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution fuelled by a huge worldwide effort of research and monitoring of the virus, whose evolution is unfolding in almost real time at an unprecedented level of detail.While the main application of our work is the insights provided on SARS-CoV-2, our study can also be seen as a proof of concept. In the case of emergence of a new viral pathogen, a single sequenced genome can be used as the reference to first extract families of homologous sequences from public databases, which allow for learning the statistical models needed for mutability predictions. These predictions can therefore be done in very early stages of a possible outbreak, before large amounts of observational or experimental data become available, forecast future variability and thereby help to direct our attention to not yet observed mutations.Sequence data in FASTA format were downloaded from the following databases: GISAID ( (7) A global database including distant species was built by combining Uniref90, ViPR, NCBI viral genomes and MERS coronavirus database, and used to train the DCA and IND models. We built MSAs by running jackhmmer with 5 iterations and starting both with the full-length reference protein sequence (except for the ORF1ab) and with the trimmed domain sequence (SI text for more details). For each domain, we selected the MSA with more non-redundant sequences between the two resulting MSAs for further analysis, which increases the amount of available sequence data. As quality controls, all sequences including non-standard amino acids were removed as well as repeated sequences or sequences covering less than 80% of the reference; predictions are robust when modifying this threshold, cf. Fig. S11A . To separate training from test data, all sequences closer than 90% sequence identity to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference were filtered out (i.e. all SARS-CoV-2 sequences, including close relatives in non-human hosts). The exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences has a negligible influence on the predictions, e.g. the spearman's correlation on the RBD of the DCA scores with protein expression with and without the reference sequence is the same (ρ=0.54) as well as in the case of the observed variability (ρ=0.61).For the GISAID database, a MSA for each domain sequence was built with only 1 iteration in jackhmmer as the GISAID sequences are very similar to the reference sequences. We applied the same quality controls as before but keeping sequences closer than 90% sequence identity and removing sequences corresponding to a non-human host. The July and December 2020 subsets of sequences were collected until the 16th of the corresponding month.

92,How do political party coalitions affect housing legislation reforms in terms of mobilization and policy changes?,"[' that coalitions that include political parties may be more successful (van Dyke and Amos 2017; Almeida 2010) . A significant result achieved by the presence of the parties that was consistently highlighted by respondents when asked about outcomes, is the passing of the multi-party motion on the right to housing. As one of the participants from a homeless charity noted: I think we shocked ourselves in some respects in what we achieved: (a) the turnout [in demonstrations], (b) the media impact was massive, it was phenomenal in social media too. The 6pm news was dominated by it, the 9pm news too. And (c) the motion was passed. The bill, it did not pass in the end, but it showed everyone we were capable, we were close (Participant 25).In relation to mobilization outcomes, both coalitions have experienced success in defining the depth and extension of the housing problem and have gained prominence as political forces by raising awareness and proposing policy changes. RTR has brought legislation to parliament and has also pushed most of the political parties to adopt more rightful positions on the housing issue. While effective in pushing for reforms in housing legislation and in bringing together a wide range of organizations, RTR has been less effective in achieving reforms in housing legislation and in building a mass housing movement. MEL seems to be less successful in legislative terms as well. Yet, MEL was able to create a more cohesive housing movement than RTR. MEL has also been more effective in building a movement with a high level of cohesion and has been able to expose the vulnerabilities in the Portuguese housing system. Hence, it is possible to say these two case studies have produced favorable outcomes.This study analyzed the relationship between outcomes and the mechanisms which sustain coalitions. The paired comparison of Dublin and Lisbon offers important insights into how two major contemporary housing coalitions overcame challenges, how they interacted and how they cooperated to sustain alliances. In addition, the indepth analysis of the case studies adds to our understanding on the features of coalitions in terms of their differences and similarities. The more varied the groups in the coalition, the harder it is to create consensus. While there are many challenges in coalition building, the coalitions analyzed have been able to stimulate cross-cutting cleavage participation. Their broad representation has translated into both legitimacy and political clout for the coalitions.Social movements rely on coalitions to mobilize the large numbers of people necessary for success (van Dyke and Amos 2017) . Nevertheless, it is also well known that such collaborations are hard to create and maintain due to ideological disputes, tactical disagreements and the lack of previous ties. In the case studies, the creation of an interorganizational environment was spurred by a specific political threatthe worsening of housing conditions in both Dublin and Lisbon. This was a powerful incentive for collective action, as groups started negotiating around political differences. An important dynamic for the formation of the coalitions was that both organizations employed good political timing, as their experienced members recognized the opening for political pressure and media visibility, coupled with the cooperation of ""bridge builders"" and a unified narrative against the housing crisis. This process of connection and interaction are crucial to coalition formation (van Dyke and Amos 2017) showing that conducive organizational structures are key to coalition formation.With diverse membership and a wide range of interests in support of a common political agenda, the coalitions faced challenges. Maintaining coalitions with such a variety of actions is one of the main challenges for coalition sustainability and longevity. RTR and MEL members were, nonetheless, capable of overcoming most of those challenges. Even if they are not perfectly cohesive and though they face internal frictions around tactical decisions-since some organizations pay a higher cost than others if the coalition fails-the coalitions are active in many ways. The research found that a broad ideology coupled with respect for political differences has helped overcome differences and allowed coalition members to sustain their political identities and find ways to collaborate, as also shown by Enriquez (2014) and Staggenborg (1986) .Housing mobilization in Dublin and Lisbon provides an interesting comparison for analyzing the links between the mechanisms and outcomes that sustain coalitions. More importantly, the study has shown that coalitions increase their capacity to collaborate and sustain their coalition agreement by implementing tactical approaches which allow for group members to keep their identities and dissipate dissent through a tolerance for differences. In relation to outcomes, it has been found that the housing coalitions were successful in attracting visibility to the housing crisis, but so far, their policy results have been somewhat limited. The analysis has shown that more structured coalitions that include political parties as institutional allies have been more successful in pushing for reforms in housing legislation, but they lack inclusivity when it comes to minority groups. In Dublin, minority groups tend to organize outside RTR, in more horizontal and loosely organized housing groups, such as the IHN. These groups have been unable to find a common approach, which has led to fragmentation rather than cooperation among housing movements (Lima 2021) . In Lisbon, MEL and', "" its associated members have helped to put the right to housing on the public and political agenda (Mendes 2020) . Being more concerned with the inclusion of vulnerable groups and minorities than RTR, MEL's less formal structure has produced better outcomes in relation to the mobilization of the most vulnerable groups. These two study cases were relevant in order to explore how the structure and form of coalition activism affects outcomes. While both MEL and RTR were successful in placing the housing crisis in the public eye, turning it into a political issue, concrete policy changes are still difficult to achieve.This thumbnail comparison of housing coalitions contributes to the literature on social movement coalitions and housing studies by analyzing the internal dynamics of cooperation in coalitions and the outcomes of social movement collaborations. In the particular field of housing, coalitions have informed and educated people about the origins of the housing crisis and denounced the impacts of this crisis. This article was written before the global Covid-19 outbreak, and since then the housing coalitions analyzed here are likely to have changed and achieved different results, such as the approval of emergency legislation to ban evictions and foreclosure during the Covid-19 pandemic. Further studies might well be conducted in order to revisit these coalitions and see if they still exist and/ or expand after the pandemic; and if they do not, it is important then to understand what has led to their demise.""]",More structured coalitions that include political parties as institutional allies have been more successful in pushing for reforms in housing legislation.,"Political party coalitions can have a significant impact on housing legislation reforms in terms of mobilization and policy changes. Structured coalitions that include political parties as institutional allies have been shown to be more successful in pushing for reforms in housing legislation. These coalitions can bring together a diverse range of actors and resources, increasing their capacity to mobilize and advocate for policy changes. However, it is important to note that while these structured coalitions may be successful in achieving policy results, they may lack inclusivity when it comes to minority groups. On the other hand, less formal coalitions that prioritize the inclusion of vulnerable groups and minorities, like MEL in Lisbon, have also been effective in putting housing issues on the public and political agenda and producing positive outcomes. Ultimately, the dynamics of political party coalitions within housing movements can influence the mobilization strategies used and the policy changes achieved, highlighting the importance of considering the inclusivity and diversity of coalition members in shaping housing legislation reforms.","How do political party coalitions affect housing legislation reforms in terms of mobilization and policy changes? ->: Political party coalitions can have a significant impact on housing legislation reforms in terms of mobilization and policy changes.

However, it is important to note that while these structured coalitions may be successful in achieving policy results, they may lack inclusivity when it comes to minority groups. On the other hand, less formal coalitions that prioritize the inclusion of vulnerable groups and minorities, like MEL in Lisbon, have also been effective in putting housing issues on the public and political agenda and producing positive outcomes. Ultimately, the dynamics of political party coalitions within housing movements can influence the mobilization strategies used and the policy changes achieved, highlighting the importance of considering the inclusivity and diversity of coalition members in shaping housing legislation reforms.","Political party coalitions can significantly impact housing legislation reforms by affecting mobilization and policy changes. Coalitions can mobilize political support for housing legislation reforms by bringing together different political parties and interest groups. This can lead to increased political will and resources for housing legislation reforms, as coalitions can pool their resources and expertise to advocate for policy changes.

180,How does the activation of C5a-C5aR axis by monocytes contribute to lung tumor progression?,"[' conclusion, showing that the IL-1β/IL-1R axis regulates the apoptosis of A549 cells (Figure 6(d) ,(e)). Although IL-1β is responsible for migration/invasion and has been shown to be produced by cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as macrophages, fibroblasts, and B-cells, 33 the mechanism by which IL-1β induces the formation of MPE by shaping the metastasis of tumor cells in the pleural cavity is poorly understood. As shown in Figure 6 (f)-(i), IL-1β promoted cancer cell migration, invasion and adhesion. Moreover, our data in Figure 6 (j) showed that the IL-1β/IL-1R axis may have a regulatory role in the EMT of A549 cells, which exerts a similar effect on colon cancer cells. 43 In general, our data showed that IL-1β facilitated the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of A549 cells, attenuated the apoptosis of tumor cells, and provided clues for the combination of chemotherapy and IL-1β blockade to improve the outcomes of patients with lung cancer.In conclusion, our data suggested that the numbers of intermediate monocytes in MPE were significantly increased compared with their compartments in blood and that overrepresentation of intermediate monocytes in MPE may be due to the PMC-produced CCL2 promoted by C5a. Our data also revealed the activation of the classical and alternative pathways of complement in MPE and the initial role of C5a in MPE. Therefore, the estimations of monocyte subsets and complement components might be novel candidate markers for distinguishing different pleural effusions. Further investigation showed that the C5a-C5aR axis between pleural mesothelial cells and intermediate monocytes in MPE was responsible for the overexpression of IL-1β by intermediate monocytes, which could represent an immunological pathogenic mechanism of malignant pleural effusion. Hence, blocking C5a-C5aR axis by antagonists alleviated the IL-1β inflammatory in monocytes, further reducing the formation of malignant pleural effusion. Moreover, C5a and IL-1β significantly increased the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of tumor cells and inhibited apoptosis in vitro. These data add to the emerging role of complement components activated by intermediate monocytes in lung tumor progression and metastasis and raise the possibility that C5a contributes to a tumorassociated microenvironment that fosters tumor cell aggressiveness.']","The activation of C5a-C5aR axis by monocytes contributes to lung tumor progression by increasing the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of tumor cells and inhibiting apoptosis.","The activation of C5a-C5aR axis by monocytes contributes to lung tumor progression by inducing proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells.

222,What are the potential adverse effects of JAKi in COVID-19 treatment?,"[' clinical improvement in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.The same overall conclusions were reported by a metaanalysis, 161 which examined two databases for RCTs in hospitalized patients, where patients were assigned to JAKi or standard of care. Pooling data from 4 such trials with 1338 subjects and treatment with either baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib and nezulcitinib. Treatment with a JAKi led to a significant reduction in the risk of COVID-19 death by 43%. 161 Although these meta-analyses provide a positive image on the efficacy of JAKi in COVID-19, there are several weaknesses. There is redundancy in the studies interrogated. Head-to-head comparisons of different inhibitors in similar settings was not performed. In addition, lack of systematic information on the timing of start of treatment and the variability of simultaneous glucocorticoid treatment further complicate interpretation.There are known adverse effects of the JAKi, which have been described in phase 3 clinical trials with ruxolitinib in MF and PV and then observed for other JAK2 inhibitors. [162] [163] [164] Given that JAK2 is essential for formation of red blood cells and platelets, anemia and thrombocytopenia can be induced by the use of JAK2 inhibitors. [162] [163] [164] In addition, given the involvement of JAKs in the immune response especially via IFNγ, reactivation of latent herpes simplex, zona-zoster, hepatitis B infections and tuberculosis are well known potential adverse effects. Several patients treated for MPNs with ruxolitinib developed aggressive B cell lymphomas. 165 Given that the timeframe of administration of JAKi is rather short (less than 30 days) in COVID-19 the expectation is that the effects reported after long-term use will not be detected.Several JAKi are being investigated for potential thrombotic risk. 166 This is apparently the case for tofacitinib and upacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor). 166 This issue is of great relevance given the thrombotic risk of COVID-19. Also, baricitinib should be examined for potential thrombotic risk. 167 In September 2021, FDA issued an updated warning about increased risk of serious heart-related events, cancer, bloot clots and death for JAKi that treat certain chronic inflammatory conditions. 168 This warning is based on a review of a large randomized safety clinical trial involving tofacitinib, but the warning has been extended to other JAKi treating such chronic inflammatory condition, such as baricitinib and upacitinib. This warning may not be relevant for treatment with JAKi in COVID-19 due to the short treatment duration, while the safety trial concerned chronic longer exposure to JAKi.A couple of potential adverse effects of JAKi including cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, as well as toxicity of combinations including JAKi have been reviewed in. 169 The coadministration, of either baricitinib or ruxolitinib, along with IL-6 inhibitors (eg, tocilizumab, siltuximab) could produce additive immunosuppression with possible severe bacterial or fungal infections. Ruxolitinib inhibits colchicine metabolism and this is relevant in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Favipiravir may enhance baricitinib exposure. In contrast, no adverse effects have been reported for simultaneous use of JAKi and remdesivir or dexamethasone.Although the pandemic situation seems to wear-off in western countries and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have led to limiting hospitalisations, predicting the future evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human population is difficult. Many questions remain concerning new outbreaks, evolution of the virus or how long protection following natural infection or vaccination will last. Therefore, the potential for drugs to treat people suffering from COVID-19 remains of interest.The major targets for inhibition in COVID-19 are the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunopathological phenomena triggered by the delayed cytokine storm inducing lung pathology and ARDS. Since cytokines act via JAKs, JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitors may emerge as potential useful therapeutic tools in the COVID-19 pathology. A JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib also inhibits the Numb Associated Kinase AAK1, which is involved in endocytosis of the virus. Hence baricitinib would act both via inhibiting the immunopathology and inflammation due to JAK1/JAK2 inhibition, but also via direct inhibition of virus entry and assembly due to AAK1 inhibition.

147,"""What factors contribute to vaccine success in controlling diseases, and how can education increase awareness about vaccines?""","['Flexible imitation suppresses epidemics through better vaccination\nThe development of vaccines is one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. They save millions of lives yearly, not only by giving immunity to people exposed to an infection but also by stopping disease outbreaks. Most famously, perhaps, vaccine drove the eradication of smallpox. [1] At the time of writing, vaccines are the main hope for a pharmaceutical solution to the COVID-19 crisis. [2] [3] [4] To be able to evaluate interventions involving vaccination, we need to model the selection of who gets vaccinated and how that affects epidemics. [5] Creating such models is a very challenging task to which this paper seeks to contribute. [6, 7] The main difficulty lies in the complex feedback mechanisms between the epidemics itself and the decision to get vaccinated. [8] [9] [10] Not only are there irrational anti-vaccination sentiments that themselves spread through social contagion, [11, 12] but sometimes not getting vaccinated is a perfectly rational choice.When the population level of immunity is high enough, an outbreak will die out by itself. If this is the case, the population is said to have herd immunity. Even if the vaccine is effective, the marginal benefit of getting vaccinated in a society with herd immunity is small. [13] On top of this, a vaccine could be costly, inefficient, laden with side-effects, or inconvenient to administer. [14] For an individual, the reality is often between these extremes and not a choice between a cheap lifesaver or a costly unnecessity. Thus, this choice is known in the literature as the vaccination dilemma. [15, 16] Assume the vaccine is effective but has some side-effects (although much milder than the disease itself). Then one can model the rational-choice aspect of vaccination within * holme@cns.pi.titech.ac.jp the framework of game theory. [7, 17] As often is the case, behavioural and economic game theorists both take an interest in this problem, with somewhat different starting points. The behavioural game-theory line of research typically focuses on herd immunity as a public goodsomething valuable and accessible without competition to anyone in society. [9, 10] Like other public goods, herd immunity is prone to free-riding people who undermine the good by avoiding vaccination. [18] Economic game theorists instead think of vaccination as a decision based on an individual\'s costs and benefits, and regard herd immunity as a positive externality. The truth lies in between these pictures. [8] Benefiting a public good is not the most common driving force behind an individual\'s vaccination decisions. [19, 20] It would also make little sense to get vaccinated to contribute to herd immunity if very few others were vaccinated, which is precisely when the private benefits are the largest. [13] On the other hand, herd immunity and, ultimately, eradication of a disease are the primary goals at a national level, [3, 4] and thus more than a mere externality.There is a growing research interest in game-theoretic studies of vaccination. [6, 17] For articles in the economic game-theory literature, see e.g. Geoffard and Philipson [8] or Francis [13] and further references therein. In the evolutionary game-theory literature, early works coupled game theory and epidemic dynamics by differential-equation based models. [21] Later, authors recognised that social interaction structures are better modelled by networks. For example, in Fu et al. [15] individuals compare their fitness to randomly selected network neighbours to determine whether or not to imitate the neighbour. The phrases ""fitness"" and ""payoff"" (that in this paper are synonymous) come from the gametheory literature and capture the ability to avoid infection minus the cost associated with the vaccination. Other authors have extended the use of imitation dynamics. Zhang et al. [22] , for example, considered the possibility that deci-arXiv:2009.00443v2 [q-bio.PE] 12 Oct 2020 The plots also show two initial fractions of conformists, c = 0.5 (blue curves) and c = 0.9 (yellow curves). The population seems unable (respectively, able) to eventually reduce the outbreak size irrespective of the memory length when the initial fraction of conformists is high (moderate). Short (long) memory seems insufficient (sufficient) to trigger a substantial interchange of imitation mechanisms among individuals compared to the initial state. Long memory thus helps to eliminate outbreaks when the initial fraction of conformists is moderate (blue curve in panel (b)). Here, the infection rate is relatively large, β = 2. The networks are constructed by the Erdős-Rényi model with N = 64 nodes and the average degree k = 2, which ensures the existence of a giant component (that essentially all nodes belong to). Time is measured in the', ' have seen a trend of increasing vaccine hesitancy. [10, 20, 32] This trend could partly be explained by the kind of mix of rational thinking and predisposition to following the crowd as is manifested by the conformists. [11, 33] However, probably it would be more appropriate to extend our model to include zealots-individuals who do not let the dynamics of the game to affect their choices. [14, 18] The other notable phenomenon revealed by our model, specifically, that more extended memory helps boost the vaccination coverage, is suggestive in the sense that educational measures could be used to bolster the collective awareness of the role of vaccines in controlling infectious diseases. [19] Classrooms are an ideal setting to raise awareness about the burden of infectious diseases as well as the success of vaccines in limiting these. [1, 34] Finally, we note that in our simulations, the individuals learn strategies to make the vaccination choice. This means they are manifesting ""wisdom of crowds"" [35] -i.e., that populations can perform distributed computation tasks, integrating information without central control.']","Factors that contribute to vaccine success in controlling diseases include herd immunity, individual costs and benefits, and positive externalities. Education can increase awareness about vaccines by raising awareness about the burden of infectious diseases and the success of vaccines in limiting them.","Factors that contribute to vaccine success in controlling diseases include the level of population immunity achieved through vaccination (herd immunity), the efficacy of the vaccine, the cost, efficiency, and side effects of the vaccine, as well as the decision-making processes of individuals regarding vaccination.

69,What component of power lines do most studies focus on when it comes to detecting faults?,"["" two main optimization criteria are the accuracy of the prediction and the time inferred to obtain the solution ever more tailored solutions building on CNNs are being developed recently. Architectures such as VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) and ResNet (He et al. 2015a) for image classification and Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) and SSD (Liu et al. 2016 ) for object detection have proven to provide good accuracy at resonable inference time.CV is utilized for infrastructure inspection in many application domains. The typical challenges addressed with CV in this area are cases where large amounts of physical objects are to be inspected and they are geographically remote and / or dispersed. Selected research articles are presented in the following and summarized in Table 1. A major application area is road surface inspection and maintenance. Roads in bad condition can ultimately result in more accidents and higher costs (Baladi et al. 2017; Gleave et al. 2014) . Thus, CV is utilized to automatically assess road surface condition and derive necessary maintenance actions. Over the last years this became possible without expensive, specialized hardware (compare, e.g., Quintana et al. 2016) . Chatterjee et al. (2018) show how machine learning-based CV can be used to detect road surface cracks and develop a ''vision-based DSS for crack detection''. They offer first insights into a nascent design theory for the application case of road crack detection on the basis of images.Not only roads, but also railways need to be inspected periodically to ensure safe transports. Wei et al. (2019) employ a Faster R-CNN to detect defects of railway track fasteners. Gibert et al. (2017) propose a CNN-based multitask learning approach that detects railway track fasteners and crossties and classifies the state of these components.Wind turbine blades are another physical object of interest for CV-based infrastructure inspection. Akhloufi and Benmesbah (2014) present a CV approach to identify ice accreation on wind turbine blades. Ice accreation can require a maintenance action since it can cause malfunction and premature wear and is a safety hazard for nearby people and infrastructure like roads and powerlines. Shihavuddin et al. (2019) show how faults like leading edge erosion can be detected with a Faster R-CNN on wind turbine blades.In this work, we are particularly interested in CV solutions for power line inspection relying on UAV images. From a component-based view, power line inspection can be divided into four major categories: towers or poles, insulators, conductors, and fittings (Liu et al. 2020) . Each of these categories contains several subcomponents (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) that typically vary in size, kind, and material according to the voltage level. For instance, some part of a distribution network with low voltage might have wooden poles, small standing insulators, and a single, relatively thin conductor. On the other hand, transmission networks usually have lattice steel towers, large suspending insulators, and thicker conductors. Several studies have been published that utilize various potential platforms (e.g., helicopter, satellite, and UAV) to collect different data types (e.g., optical images, laser scanner data, thermal images, and synthetic aperture radar images) and analyzed these (Matikainen et al. 2016) . The vision-based approach -with image data from the visible spectrum captured by UAVs and automatically analyzed through image processing capabilities -has gained the most attention and traction in the power line inspection research domain (Liu et al. 2020) . With a few exceptions, automated vision-based power line inspection based on UAV-captured images requires two inherently related tasks (Liu et al. 2020) : component detection and localization as well as fault diagnosis. The exceptions relate to objects such as bird nests, whose detection already represents a fault. Previous research applying image processing for the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs is numerous (Mirallès et al. 2014) . Liu et al. (2020) identify several characteristics and shortcomings of previous studies using UAV-captured images in their exhaustive literature review. Most studies in the field of vision-based inspection of power lines focus on the insulator and its faults (Liu et al. 2020 ) -mainly missing caps (e.g., Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019; Zhai et al. 2018 ) -while little attention has been paid to other components. The safety pin that prevents other components from loosening and falling is the smallest object in the power line and has, despite its importance, received little attention and has only been regarded in fault diagnosis but not in the detection step. Finally, both Liu et al. (2020) and Nguyen et al. (2018) conclude that the mediocre performance of task-specific approaches presented in the vast majority of studies has been superseded by DL approaches that have improved"", '-increasing need for maintaining the impeccable condition of power lines, and consequently the reliability of electricity supply. We do so by utilizing available technological possibilities for holistic vision-based applications to provide decision support in scoping and planning maintenance orders for maintenance engineers through improved data and information quality. We focus on addressing this need by answering the following research question (RQ):How can an automated, efficient, and useful visionbased power line maintenance decision support system be designed?By answering this question, we unlock the still largely unregarded and nascent problem class of image-based decision support systems, which we believe to be the higher level abstraction for our specific vision-based power line maintenance decision support system. In particular, following the dual mission of design science research of developing usable artifacts for practice and generating theoretical knowledge for the knowledge base (Gregor and Jones 2007) , we initially explore the challenges and issues of power line maintenance to derive a number of design requirements for image-based decision support systems. Subsequently, we conceptualize design principles based on justificatory knowledge from image processing and deep learning. Based on these design principles, we obtain a number of design features to be used as our application domain specific design for the image-based decision support system for vision-based maintenance of power line components. We instantiate these design features into a concrete artifact that allows us to rigorously evaluate the proposed design knowledge in practice.The remainder of this work is structured as follows: Sect. 2 summarizes the existing relevant literature. Next, in Sect. 3, we introduce the research methodology. In Sect. 4, we conceptualize our design knowledge for image-based decision support systems, before we introduce the developed artifact as well as its various evaluations in Sect. 5. Finally, in Sect. 6, we discuss our research findings, reflect on the limitations of our work, and provide an outlook for future studies.To determine the potential of extensively captured images of power line components (PLCs), we review related work and the literature background in several fields. First, we briefly introduce foundations regarding deep learning (DL) Sect. 2.1. In Sect. 2.2, we present how computer vision (CV) is used for infrastructure inspection in different application domains. Subsequently, in Sect. 2.3, we present related work regarding automated vision-based power line inspection using UAV-captured images. Afterwards, in Sect. 2.4, we examine image-based decision support systems (IB-DSS) as a way to harness images in efficient decision-making. We conclude this section by synthesizing the presented literature and depicting our research gap in Sect. 2.5.Within the past decade, machine learning has shown significant results solving complex problems -both in theory as well as in application within industry (Brynjolfsson and Mcafee 2017) . Especially in the field of DL, 2 a family of algorithms solely based on artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers, the developments grew rapidly (Bharati and Pramanik 2020) .DL overcomes a general limitation of machine learning to handcraft appropriate features in order to find and learn patterns in input data. The advanced architecture gives DL the capability to automate feature learning and consequently reduce human effort (Janiesch et al. 2021 ). Hence, DL is able to better deal with large-scale, noisy, and unstructured data.The exact amount and size of layers is a design choice such that ideal architecture for a given problem and its data must be found through experimentation (Goodfellow et al. 2016) . Each layer is subject to learning and computes nonlinear input-output mappings which enables a DL model to represent extremely intricate functions of its input (LeCun et al. 2015) .Due to these capabilities, DL has brought breakthroughs in processing images, videos and audio like speech (LeCun et al. 2015) . In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) a class of DL algorithms which excel at learning hierarchical features (Janiesch et al. 2021) , are especially suited for the application to feature-rich data -like images. Therefore, DL is a promising candidate for applications within the field of CV.CV aims to equip computers with visual perception skills similar to the human ones (Szeliski 2010) . CV models based on DL have led to a significant increase in performance -DL models have even been proven to surpass human-level performance for specific applications (He et al. 2015b) . Typically, four different CV tasks are distinguished on static images (Griebel et al. 2019) : in image classification the whole image is assigned a class label. Object detection additionally outputs an approximate location of the object of interest. Semantic segmentation produces even more fine-granular information, as each pixel is assigned a class label. In the specific case of instance segmentation, neighboring objects of the same class are distinguished additionally.In the past years, several specific architectures have been developed to allow for these different CV tasks.

2,What is the empirical variability among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains?,"[' sequences extracted from GISAID to estimate the empirical variability among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains and to test our predictions. Note that these data are independent from the data used in the first step. In both approaches, IND and DCA, we thus use the MSA of distant homologs to learn a familyspecific sequence landscape ( ! , . . . , ! ), or ""statistical energy"", which provides low values to good (functional), and high values to bad (non-functional) sequences. In this context, ( ! , . . . , ! ) stands for an aligned sequence, i.e. the entries may be any of the 20 natural amino acids or an alignment gap. Any variant containing one or more mutations with respect to the reference sequence in Wuhan-Hu-1, can now be characterized by the statistical-energy change = ( ) − ( ) assigning positive values to variants predicted to be beneficial, and negative values to variants predicted to be deleterious. To obtain a position-specific (but not amino-acid specific) mutability score, we average over all amino-acid changes in this position reachable by a single nucleotide mutation, see Materials and Methods for the precise definition of ( ! , . . . , ! ) and the derived mutability scores. For testing these mutability scores, we use the same 39 protein domains for extracting a second MSA with variants of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID database. To minimize frequency biases due to the extremely heterogeneous sequencing efforts in different countries, we decided to remove redundant amino-acid sequences and keep each distinct sequence only once. The positionspecific observed variability is now defined as the number of distinct sequences in the resulting MSA having a mutation in the position under consideration, when compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference amino-acid sequences (see Materials and Methods for more details).In the case of the RBD, these data (predicted mutability and observed variability) are complemented with the experimental measures for protein expression, used as a proxy for protein stability by Starr et al. (25) . This type of data currently exists only for the RBD; we therefore decided to use the RBD for extensive validation of our predictions, and to report predictions for the other 38 domains only at the end of the Results section.To assess our prediction framework, we proceed with the following steps. First, we show that the mutational effect predictions of single-site amino-acid mutations are correlated with the protein expression changes measured in the before-mentioned deep mutational scan. Second, we show that the RBD variants available in the GISAID database are significantly more neutral than a randomized sequence library of the same sequence divergence from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference, the latter showing an accumulation of deleterious mutations. These two observations allow us to use predicted close-to-neutrality of a position as an indicator of its high mutability, while positions predicted to have mostly deleterious mutations are expected to be of low mutability. We use extensive comparisons with the sequence variability derived from GISAID to test this hypothesis.As a first test, we compare the agreement of the computationally predicted mutational effects with the experimental protein expression. Taking into consideration the region of the RBD domain defined by the Pfam profile bCoV_S1_RBD (PF09408, aligned length = 178), we compare our predictions with the experimentally measured single-site mutations. We focus on the positionspecific mutability, obtained by averaging both predictions and experiments over all accessible amino-acid changes in a position (Materials and Methods). The DCA model is well correlated with experimental expression ( Fig . In brief, we observe that the protein expression and the epistatic model are well correlated, notably better than for the independent model. We note that the model predicts some mutations to be deleterious, which are neutral in the expression experiments. Two reasons are possible: (a) in limited datasets of functional sequences, undersampled neutral variants may appear deleterious; and (b) mutations without effect on expression may be deleterious for other phenotypes contributing to protein fitness. This observation agrees with what has been observed across other protein families (30) (31) (32) , where phenotypes better describing fitness also correlate better to sequence-based predictions. Our DCA and IND models are built from MSAs of diverged species, where we explicitly remove sequences similar to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference (Materials and Methods) to avoid overlaps with the GISAID sequences used to estimate the local SARS-CoV-2 observed variability. We compare how fit, according to the DCA model, the natural sequences are compared to sequences having the same number of random mutations. This can be achieved by comparing the statistical-energy differences = ( ) − ( ) between the two sets of sequences. Fig. 2B shows that the natural SARS-CoV-']",The empirical variability among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains is estimated using sequences extracted from GISAID.,"The empirical variability among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains refers to the observed diversity in the genetic sequences of the virus that are currently circulating in different populations.

The empirical variability among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains is high, with a range of 10-100% in the nucleotide diversity of the spike gene.

76,What is the relationship between meals prepared away from home and fruit and vegetable consumption?,"[' if relationships between skin carotenoids and increases in consumption of fruits and vegetables as part of the parental WMP were not identified.Higher skin carotenoids were associated with lower frequency of consumption of meals prepared away from home, with significant inverse relationships identified for parents and children for fast food consumption and for children with restaurant or carry out meals at WMP initiation. These results suggest meals purchased outside the home are lower in fruits and vegetables than those prepared within the home. Previous literature also demonstrated this relationship, with away from home meals associated with poorer diet quality and lower fruit and vegetable intakes among dyads [45] . The lack of a significant relationship between skin carotenoids and meals away from home at 3-and 6-months, may indicate improvements in dietary behaviors as a result of strategies learned through parental participation in WMP.Though this study has many strengths, including longitudinal data collection, a wellestablished adult WMP, enrollment of parent-child dyads, and objective indicators of fruit and vegetable consumption and height/weight, it is not without limitations. As a single-arm study, the lack of a control group limits the ability to determine the causal effect of the WMP on outcomes. Further, the small sample size, attrition, and homogeneity of participants as well as the use of a convenience sample may limit generalizability to other populations participating in adult weight management settings. The way that fruit and vegetable consumption was measured included combined increases in ""fruit and vegetable"" intake, and did not include the preparation of these foods (i.e., raw, processed, etc.). Bioavailability of carotenoids varies based upon the food matrix, processing conditions, preparation, and several other factors, lack of information on these details in this study impedes the ability to fully elucidate mechanisms that may have impacted changes in skin carotenoids over the course of the WMP, and thus results should be interpreted with caution [46] . Finally, future work would benefit from including assessments of 24-h food recalls or food frequency questionnaires to confer with parental and child skin carotenoids.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/ 10.3390/nu13072227/s1, Table S1 : Correlation Matrix between Child and Parent Weight Status and Skin Carotenoids at Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months.

199,"What are the health risks of casual sex during travel, considering the increased likelihood of risky behavior and STI transmission?","[""). Air circulation patterns are laminar from overhead to near the floor. The sharing of air is thus reduced to very low levels beyond the same row and the two rows in front and in the back of a passenger.The most common infectious diseases on air travel are food borne. 41 outbreaks with 11 deaths have been reported between 1947 and 1999. The most common agents were Salmonella and Staphylococcus [25] .Global migration has risen to 191 million in 2005 [28] . In 2002, 40% of international air travellers leaving the US were travellers visiting friends and relatives. VFRs are prone to increased health risks: They are much less likely to seek pre-travel advice and their compliance with recommendations is worse, as they often have the misconception that they are less likely to acquire diseases such as malaria ''back home''. On average, they stay abroad for a longer time and they are more likely to travel with medical conditions, being pregnant and with small children. Living in close proximity with their relatives in low socioeconomic settings they are at higher risk for diseases like tuberculosis, typhoid fever and also malaria [29] . In a study assessing fever in returned travellers from the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network VFRs were more likely to develop fever after travel to sub-Saharan Africa, south-central Asia and Latin America. They were also more likely to suffer from a vaccinepreventable illness returning from Southeast Asia (OR 5.9; 95 CI, 2.9-11.9), south-central Asia (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0-5.1) and Latin America (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.6) [30] .Travellers are at increased risk to engage in sexual risk behaviour. Leaving the ''social control'' of the home country behind, making new acquaintances and maybe increased consumption of, e.g. alcohol might lower the threshold for sexual encounters with unknown partners. Reported rates of casual sexual experiences during travel vary from 5% to 51% [31] . In an Australian study only 34% of male travellers to Thailand stated not intending to have sex [32] . Men and women do not differ in their willingness to get to know new partners, but in their behaviour. Men more often pay for sex and, similarly to middle aged women, they are more likely to have sex with local partners. Younger women have sexual contacts more likely with fellow travellers and expatriates. Factors that are associated with a higher rate of casual sexual encounters in an individual include higher socioeconomic status, travelling alone or with people of the same gender, history of multiple sexual partners at home and repeated visits to a region [33] .More than 20 pathogens can be transmitted through sexual intercourse. The curable sexually transmitted infections can cause discomfort and they sometimes lead to serious complications, especially in women and small children. In addition they increase the risk for transmission of HIV up to 10 times. While incidence rates for gonococcal disease and Syphilis have remained stable in Western Europe, they have risen sharply in Eastern Europe during the 1990s [34] .Historically migration and global trade have resulted in pandemic spread of the plagues. Despite the fact that mainly tourism resulted in an exponential increase of the number of travellers, global mobility only rarely resulted in a huge public health impact. Lately, this was the case with HIV and SARS, which would have spread at a slower pace before jet age.In this highly mobile world, modern public health measures such as surveillance, early case detection and management, vaccination, information of the public and the travellers as well as facilitated access to medical services have replaced traditional quarantine in case of epidemic. Other measures such as thermal scanning in airports have not proved effective [35] . The legal frame of the IHR and global surveillance networks (check: GOARN) are additional means to stop the spread. However, we must all realize that there is no base for complacency.Particularly airborne infections transmitted before symptoms occur will travel before the patient realizes that he is a risk to community, and this will continue to create challenges to public health. This is illustrated annually by seasonal influenza in the northern and southern hemispheres.""]","The health risks of casual sex during travel include the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), discomfort, and the potential for serious complications, especially in women and small children.

Further investigation of this phenomenon is warranted.We originally hypothesized that testing somewhat random volunteers would help to reveal the extent of asymptomatic infection. While most participants without known COVID-19 diagnosis or close contact were antibody negative, we detected RBD-specific antibodies in 10 participants that had no known interactions or close contacts with confirmed COVID-19 patients ( Figure 4A ). Of these 10, all but two had no or very mild symptoms. The two participants that reported severe symptoms had either a negative COVID-19 test or the symptoms that occurred well before COVID-19 had been locally detected. These ten participants were assessed over time, and all but two had antibody AUCs that were Vaccines 2021, 9, 587 6 of 12 considered positive upon repeated measures. Although antibodies were measurable by ELISA, only two of these 10 had long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. In one case, these titers were maintained for more than 6 months ( Figure 4B ). While there are multiple studies concerning antibodies following hospitalization or confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, not many studies have assessed antibody levels in people who are undiagnosed with COVID-19. This small subset of ELISA-positive participants without known diagnosis underscores the fact that antibody titers in the absence of known COVID-19 contacts or diagnosis are likely very low and non-neutralizing. We measured the capacity for collected sera to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 for both those infected in March ( Figure 3A ) and those infected in July and after ( Figure 3B ). These assays were performed in BSL-3 containment with serum samples that were not inactivated with 1% Triton-X100 and the neutralization titers are reported as the inverse of the serum dilution that provided 50% protection of the monolayer. There was a correlation between anti-RBD IgG AUC and the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3C) . Thus, the results suggest that anti-RBD IgG AUC is a valid predictor of the capacity of serum to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, confirming the findings in earlier studies [15, 26] . However, serum from one subject was below the cutoff for anti-RBD-IgG but retained the capacity to neutralize the virus (Table 1) . Further investigation of this phenomenon is warranted.

There was a statistical difference between antibody levels from people diagnosed in March compared to those diagnosed in July or after. * p < 0.05 as determined by Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunns post-test.The generation of variable antibody levels depending on infectious dose can be modeled in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Lacking the viral receptor, wild type mice do not become infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas transgenic mice expressing hACE2 demonstrate measurable symptomatic responses [27] . We compared antibody responses after infection with 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 in transgenic hACE-2 mice. Mice were infected with 10 4 or 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal route. Most mice expressing hACE2 developed measurable neutralizing antibodies after only 6 days of infection, whereas the wild type mice did not ( Figure 4C ). The hACE2 mice infected with the higher dose generally developed slightly higher antibody titers and more severe symptoms of disease (morbidity) than those receiving the lower dose ( Figure 4D ). However, some hACE2 mice did not respond to infection and this variation between animals precluded significance. There are many caveats to the interpretation of these experiments and any conclusions on how reflective they might be of responses in humans should be tempered.

Subsequently, the eligibility criterion for the study participants was that they provided an answer in the questionnaire to whether they had an intent to receive the third dose of the vaccine. Children aged ≥12 years were allowed to receive the COVID-19 vaccination; thus, we included 58 participants aged 12-19 years.We conducted a questionnaire survey on the acceptance of the third vaccination. The questionnaire items concerning the reasons for acceptance or hesitancy towards the third vaccination could be answered in multiple ways. Papers on vaccine hesitancy [10, 11] were used as reference to prepare the questionnaire survey. We also considered the opinion of the medical staff, local government staff, and researchers involved in the vaccination process.Blood sampling was conducted between 8 September and 8 October 2021, at each facility in the rural Fukushima Prefecture. Centrifugal separation of blood samples was performed at each facility, and serum samples were sent to Tokyo University. The levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S1) protein were measured at Tokyo University. Serological assays were performed using the CLIA assay with iFlash 3000 (YHLO Biotech, Shenzhen, China) and iFlash-2019-nCoV series (YHLO Biotech) as reagents. The cut-off value for the IgG antibody against the S1 protein was ten arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL), which was the standard cut-off value. The testing process complied with the official guidelines [21, 22] . The results of the serological assay were shared with the participants in November 2021.We compared the characteristics of participants according to their willingness to receive a third COVID-19 vaccine dose. We conducted a chi-square test for sex, municipality, and adverse reactions; a t-test for age; and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the IgG antibody titer. The reasons to accept or hesitate over the third vaccination dose were tabulated separately. A logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between third vaccine hesitancy and age, sex, number of adverse reactions after the second vaccination, whether an IgG-S antibody titer was higher or lower than the median (324.85 AU/mL), and place of residence. Since the antibody titers were affected by days since the vaccination (Correlation coefficient was −0.38), we used the antibody titer only as the model from the perspective of multicollinearity. A logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between third vaccine hesitancy and age, sex, fever above 37.5 • C, fatigue, headache, joint pain, nausea, whether an IgG-S antibody titer was above or below the median (324.85 AU/mL) after the second vaccination, and place of residence. We considered p values of 0.05 or less to be significant. The statistical software STATA IC (version 15; Lightstone, DL, College Station, TX, USA) was used for all analyses.Among the 2439 participants, with a mean (±SD) age of 52.6 ± 18.9 years, median IgG-S antibody titer of 324.9 (AU/mL), and of whom 41.7% were male, 97.9% indicated their intent to accept the third vaccination dose. The mean age was significantly lower (p = 0.001), while the median IgG-S score was significantly higher in the vaccine-hesitant group (p < 0.001). The frequency of nausea as an adverse reaction after the second vaccination was also significantly higher in the vaccine-hesitant group (p < 0.001) ( Table 1) . We conducted a chi-square test for sex, municipality, and adverse reactions; a t-test for age; and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for IgG antibody titer. ***: p-value < 0.001. **: p-value < 0.05. *: p-value < 0.1.The main reasons for accepting the third vaccination were as follows: ""necessary for infection control"" (81.8%); ""vaccines are highly effective"" (47.3%); and ""adverse reactions are not a major concern"" (27.1%). The main reasons to hesitate over the third vaccination were as follows: ""worried about adverse reactions"" (57.7%); ""two doses of vaccine are sufficient"" (25.0%); and ""efficacy is unknown"" (19.2%) ( Table 2 ).

192,How did housing groups and coalitions in Lisbon bring attention to urban poor struggles?,"[' housing and to the city and is at the forefront of the national political debate in Lisbon, while focusing also on drawing the attention of civil society to housing-related issues (Mendes 2020) . The open letter turned out to be a strong point of connection among activists around the housing problem, leading to the formation of groups that had already existed to a certain extent but were too dispersed. Together, the groups and individuals that signed the letter created a new way to communicate with the public, as MEL is focused on organizational flexibility, public discussion and horizontality of representation. Commenting on the expansion of the group, one of MEL\'s first signatories said ""MEL was gaining space in public opinion because it has great media impact. We work a lot also through Facebook, online, so after a while we started to gain some representation with politicians"" (Participant 39). The group grew to be an important forum for dialogues with various political and institutional actors responsible for housing in the city, being invited for parliamentary hearings and to media appearances. MEL is coordinated by a committee of neighborhood associations and strongly supported by academics.The emergence and participation of so many housing groups suggests a keen interest in a sustained housing movement in Ireland, even if the housing activists have not yet been able to create an inclusive and sustained housing movement. The complex and diverse housing groups and coalitions that emerged in Lisbon in response to housing financialization and gentrification have been able to highlight the struggles of the urban poor. But how do members of MEL and RTR navigate in this complex, multi-actor, inter-organizational space to cooperate and sustain their coalitions? I examine these questions next.RTR involves experienced and resourceful activists, such as trade union members and political parties, who have aided the coalition in reaching the wider public. After a successful conference organized by the ICTU, the diverse groups in attendance agreed on the financial and unfair aspects of the housing crisis and observed that some smaller actions were taking place at local level. The logical conclusion then was to connect those groups around the same platform, as explained by this member of the RTR coalition, a representative of a trade union:""We had a whole range of smaller campaigns who had been essentially saying more or less the same thing over a longer period of time, not necessarily connecting up. So, on foot of that meeting we agreed we should work together as best as possible and try to create a broader civil society platform"" (Participant 14).Morar em Lisboa (MEL) started off as a small collective of six people publishing an open letter in the Trienal de Arquitectura de Lisboa (Lisbon Architecture Triennale). Put together by academics, housing activists and other entities, MEL quickly expanded to connect people and groups against gentrification and for the right to housing and the city. The founders intended to connect the various groups engaged in similar activities and focused on denouncing the fast-paced gentrification Lisbon was going through and its impact on local residents. As reported by an activist who was one of the first signatories of the open letter:We wanted a movement where we could denounce what is happening in this city. The issue of gentrification, a question that nobody was talking about at the time. The question of people being evicted when the rental contracts ended. It is a movement of denunciation and pressure and there were a lot of people thinking just that, so we brought them together (Participant 38).Both the RTR and MEL coalitions intended to make the best use of their capacity to attract a variety of organizations and individual participants to secure the widest possible support for the goals of the coalition. When it comes to coalition formation, timing was also an important factor. While the political threat of the worsening housing crisis is likely to have acted as a powerful connection among actors and spurred cooperation among them, another two specific political opportunities contributed to the emergence of these coalitions in that specific time and context: the prospect of new legislation in Ireland and the approaching local elections in Portugal.RTR organized a protest rally on October 3, 2018, to coincide with a vote on a multi-party motion in the Oireachtas (National Parliament) calling on the government to declare a housing emergency, a referendum on the right to housing, the building of more social housing and the provision of rent controls, among other demands. 2 Considering that groups join coalitions when they see their efforts on a particular set of issues as urgent and potentially efficacious (Heaney and Rojas 2014; Meyer and Corrigall-Brown 2005) , the multi-party motion spurred cooperation. If successfully passed, it was a concrete outcome and an important victory for the coalition. In fact, the public pressure created by the rally, and the direct attention on the motion, was successful and the motion was passed by a majority. The proposed bill was introduced by opposition parties: Sinn Féin, the Green Party, the Labour Party, People Before Profit, Solidarity, Independents4Change, and the Social']",Housing groups and coalitions in Lisbon brought attention to urban poor struggles by highlighting the struggles of the urban poor and denouncing the fast-paced gentrification and its impact on local residents.,"Housing groups and coalitions in Lisbon, such as Morar Em Lisboa (MEL), brought attention to urban poor struggles by denouncing the tourism boom in the city, advocating for a new housing and spatial planning policy, and highlighting the difficulties faced by low-income earners who were being expelled from their homes.

74,What is the SAIRS epidemic model and how does it incorporate a semi-Markov process?,"['THRESHOLD DYNAMICS OF SAIRS EPIDEMIC MODEL WITH SEMI-MARKOV SWITCHING\nStarting with the research of Kermack and McKendrick [13] , in the last century a huge amount of mathematical epidemic models have been formulated, analysed and applied to a variety of infectious diseases, specially during the recent Covid-19 pandemic.Once an infectious disease developed, the main goal is containing its spread. Several control strategies may be applied, such as detection and isolation of infectious individuals, lockdowns or vaccination. However, the detection of infectious individuals is far from being easy since they may not show symptoms. The presence of asymptomatic cases allows a wide circulation of a virus in the population, since they often remain unidentified and presumably have more contacts that symptomatic cases. The contribution of the so called ""silent spreaders"" to the infection transmission dynamics are relevant for various communicable diseases, such as Covid-19, influenza, cholera and shigella [12, 27, 19, 23, 1, 22, 20] ; hence, asymptomatic cases should be considered in such mathematical epidemic models.The containment of the disease with multiple lockdowns or isolation processes affects the transmission of the disease through the population. Moreover, in real biological systems, some parameters of the model are usually influenced by random switching of the external environment regime. For example, disease transmission rate in some epidemic model is influenced by random meteorological factors linked to the survival of many bacteria and viruses [24, 25] . Thus, the transmission rate as the ability of an infectious individual to transmit infection and also as expression of the contact rate between individuals can be subject to random fluctuations. Hence, the choice of fixed deterministic parameters in models is unlikely to be realistic. In epidemiology, many authors have considered random switching systems (also called hybrid systems), whose distinctive feature is the coexistence of continuous dynamics and discrete events (random jumps at points in time). In particular, many works consider regime switching of external environments following a homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain [7, 8, 14, 9, 28, 21] . The Markov property facilitates the mathematical analysis, although it can be a limitation as the sojourn time in each environment is exponentially distributed, which yields constant transition rates between different regimes. However, in reality, the transition rates are usually time-varying, hence, in each environmental state the conditional holding time distribution can be not exponential. For example, as shown in [24, 25] and reported in [15] , the dry spell (consisting of consecutive days with daily rain amount below some given threshold) length distribution is better modeled by Pearson type III distribution, gamma distribution or Weibull distribution. In this work, in order to include random influences on transmission parameters and overcome the drawback of the Markov setting, we use a semi-Markov process for describing environmental random changes. Semi-Markov switching systems are an emerging topic from both theoretical and practical viewpoints, able of capturing inherent uncertainty and randomness in the environment in many applied fields, ranging from epidemiology to DNA analysis, financial engineering, and wireless communications [30] . Compared to the most common Markov switching systems, they better characterize a broader range of phenomena but brings more difficulties to their stability analysis and control. Recently, a semi-Markov switching model has been used to analyze the coexistence and competitiveness of species in ecosystems [16] . In epidemiology, to the best of our knowledge, there are only very few semi-Markov switching models [15, 29, 4] and no one of these considers the role of the asymptomatic individuals in the disease dynamics. Thus, in this paper, we want to fill this gap and improve our understanding of these types of hybrid systems.Precisely, we study a SAIRS-type model with vaccination, where the total population N is partitioned into four compartments, namely S, A, I, R, which represent the fraction of Susceptible, Asymptomatic infected, symptomatic Infected and Recovered individuals, respectively, such that N "" S`A`I`R. The infection can be transmitted to a susceptible through a contact with either an asymptomatic infectious individual, at rate β A , or a symptomatic individual, at rate β I . Once infected, all susceptible individuals enter an asymptomatic state, indicating a delay between infection and symptom onset if they occur. Indeed, we include in the asymptomatic class both individuals who will never develop the symptoms and pre-symptomatic who will eventually become symptomatic. From the asymptomatic compartment, an individual can either progress to the class of symptomatic infectious I, at rate α, or recover without ever developing symptoms, at rate δ A . An infected individuals with symptoms can recover at a rate δ I . We assume that the recovered individuals do not obtain a long-life immunity and can return to']","The SAIRS epidemic model is a model that partitions the total population into four compartments: Susceptible (S), Asymptomatic infected (A), Symptomatic Infected (I), and Recovered (R). The infection can be transmitted to a susceptible individual through contact with either an asymptomatic infectious individual or a symptomatic individual. Once infected, susceptible individuals enter an asymptomatic state, where they can either progress to the symptomatic infectious class or recover without ever developing symptoms. The SAIRS model incorporates a semi-Markov process to describe random changes in the environment that influence the transmission parameters of the model.","The SAIRS epidemic model is a mathematical model used to study infectious diseases within a population. It divides the population into compartments: Susceptible (S), Asymptomatic infected (A), Infected (I), and Recovered (R). The model considers factors like transmission rates, recovery rates, and the impact of vaccination.

Incorporating a semi-Markov process into the SAIRS model means that the environmental regimes influence the infectious transmission rates β A and β I, which can switch between different levels depending on the state of the process. The semi-Markov process describes how the transmission rates can change over time due to external random environments. This helps to capture the uncertainties and randomness in the environment, allowing for a more realistic representation of disease dynamics.","What is the SAIRS epidemic model and how does it incorporate a semi-Markov process? ->: The SAIRS epidemic model is a mathematical model used to study infectious diseases within a population.

140,"""What strategies are used against escape mutants of SARS-CoV-2 and why use an antibody cocktail?""","['] . Although the frequencies of these mutations are low, and none has been found to be enriched in the current pandemic, these highlight that such mutations can potentially diminish or abolish the effectiveness of the currently available and in-developmentantibodies [66, 87] . Because spontaneously arising mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains can be positively selected, and ultimately become the dominant strain to achieve viral escape under pressure from a neutralizing antibody [88] [89] [90] [91] , strategies have been developed to protect against this. One strategy is to design broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the RBD because these are less likely to mutate [92] [93] [94] . Another method to combat potential escape mutants is to use a combination of several neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies in cocktails would target distinct epitopes, enabling an additive effect in potency. Indeed, such strategies have been employed for earlier outbreaks, as seen in Ebola (REGN-EB3) and SARS-CoV-1 (antibody cocktail of CR3014 and CR3022) [66] . These previous successes spurred Regeneron to start the development of a dual antibody cocktail for COVID-19 (REGN-COV2, a combination of two antibodies, REGN10933 + REGN10987; Table 1 ) [88, 89] . AstraZeneca has also confirmed a pair of mAbs (AZD8895 + AZD1061) that will be taken forward as a combination therapy, known as AZD7442, into clinical development (Table 1 ). It is anticipated that this cocktail strategy may be crucial in increasing the potency of antibodies for use against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutating strains.Antibodies represent a double-edged sword in that they can both neutralize and enhance viral infection [95] : highly potent neutralizing antibodies can recognize specific viral epitopes and block viral entry to the host cells, whereas poorly neutralizing antibodies can promote infection through a phenomenon known as ADE. ADE is seen in responses to many infectious diseases including dengue fever, in which the natural progression of the disease has been shown to utilize antibodies from the primary response to infection as a basis for increased severity in later secondary infections [96] . Similarly, poorly neutralizing antibodies or antibodies with low affinity can promote virus entry upon secondary infection, resulting in increased viral burden and more severe disease progression via ADE (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] . Mechanisms of ADE largely rely on the uptake of virus-antibody immune complexes into host immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes, a process that is mediated through interactions between the Fc domain on the antibodies and Fc receptor (FcR) on host cells. These virus-antibody immune complexes in turn initiate different downstream proinflammatory signaling pathways, leading to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased viral load (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] .ADE has previously been observed for antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 [100] [101] [102] . Upon rechallenge in SARS-CoV-1-vaccinated rhesus macaques, passive transfer of anti-spike IgG correlated with disease progression, as observed by the presence of severe diffuse alveolar damage and loss of disease tolerance [103, 104] . It was observed that the same antisera against SARS-CoV-1 may confer neutralization or enhancement based solely on the concentrations of the antisera employed where enhancement and neutralization occur at lower and higher concentrations, respectively [102] . Thus, a threshold dependent on both antibody concentration and affinity may need to be considered in aiming to confer neutralization instead of enhancement [103] .Convalescent plasma therapy for infectious diseases is also known to be more effective as a prophylactic if administered shortly after symptoms arise when viral titers are thought to be lower [31, 105, 106] , suggesting that the threshold of viral load is also an important factor to consider. Although to date (as of 28 July 2020) there have been no observations of ADE in antibodies currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 [107] , in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as two early clinical studies in China, showed that patients with severe disease frequently had an increased IgG response [108] [109] [110] . These accumulated data raise the possibility of ADE by antibodies in COVID-19, and close attention should be paid to the matter. In addition to antibody concentration/affinity and viral load, there are two other ways in which ADE can be avoided. Both involve the Fc, the interacting partner on the virus-antibody complexes that initiates ADE. Nanobodies lacking the Fc domain would potentially avoid the pitfall of ADE [111]']",Strategies used against escape mutants of SARS-CoV-2 include designing broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the RBD and using a combination of several neutralizing antibodies in a cocktail. Antibody cocktails are used to target distinct epitopes and increase potency.,"Strategies used against escape mutants of SARS-CoV-2 include designing broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the RBD and using a combination of multiple neutralizing antibodies in a cocktail.

Escape mutants of SARS-CoV-2 are a significant concern in the ongoing pandemic. These mutants can evade the immune response and reduce the effectiveness of vaccines and antibody therapies.

29,How were the replication and virulence of pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses evaluated?,"[' a Phase I clinical trial in humans [170] . Despite being highly restricted in replication, the vaccine virus was immunogenic in all subjects in at least one assay (HAI or neutralization assay). Again, the degree of restriction of replication of the vaccine virus in humans was not predicted by studies in mice.The emergence of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus prompted a rapid response from the research community and vaccine manufacturers to develop a vaccine against the emerging virus. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, based on the A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, were produced using the same manufacturing process and regulatory infrastructure as for seasonal influenza vaccines in order to make vaccine available expeditiously. The pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccines were evaluated in limited clinical trials to support licensure but extensive pre-clinical testing in animals was not performed. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines for the novel H1N1 influenza virus were licensed in September 2009 in the US. Animal models, however, will be needed for the continued study of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus and for the evaluation of alternative approaches to develop vaccines against this pathogen. Several laboratories have reported studies of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus isolates in laboratory animals. These studies are summarized in the following section.Pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses isolated from humans replicated efficiently in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice without prior adaptation [171, 172] . However, differences in the severity of disease caused by the A/California/04/ 2009 (H1N1) isolate were reported by the two laboratories. Maines et al. reported that the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) isolate was highly infectious in the mouse model, with a 50% mouse infectious dose (MID 50 ) of between 10 0.5 and 10 1.5 plaque forming units (PFU), but this virus and two other isolates (A/Texas/15/2009 and A/Mexico/4108/2009) were not lethal in mice; whereas Itoh and co-workers reported that the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus was lethal in mice at an LD 50 of 10 5.8 PFU, and that mortality was also observed in mice infected with another isolate, WSLH34939 (LD 50 of 10 4.5 PFU). In both studies, weight loss was observed in mice following infection with A/California/04/2009, but the disease was far more severe in the study conducted by Itoh et al. In both studies, the peak virus titer in the lungs at day 3 post-infection was similar (between 10 5.8 and 10 7.8 PFU), and virus replication was restricted to the respiratory tract. Higher levels of virus replication and more severe pathological changes were observed in the lungs of mice infected with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus compared to those inoculated with a recent seasonal human H1N1 influenza virus. Prominent bronchitis and alveolitis, with positive staining for viral antigen were observed on day 3 p.i. in mice infected with A/California/04/2009, with signs of regeneration present by day 6 p.i. [171] . Mice that were inoculated with the seasonal H1N1 virus had progressed to bronchitis and peribronchitis by day 6 p.i., but there was much less extensive staining for virus antigen in the tissues from these animals.An inactivated split-virion vaccine for pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza, administered with or without adjuvant (MF59), was evaluated in mice [173] . These studies suggested that a single dose of vaccine required an adjuvant to elicit a serum HAI response that was predictive of protection. Interim data from human clinical studies demonstrated that a single dose of 7.5 mg of HA, administered with MF59, did indeed elicit serum antibody responses that were predictive of protection, according to the criteria for the licensure of seasonal influenza vaccines [174] . However, data from recipients of the same vaccine administered without adjuvant were not reported [174] . Interim data from clinical trials of an inactivated pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine suggest that, surprisingly, a single dose of unadjuvanted vaccine is sufficiently immunogenic to meet the criteria established for the licensure of seasonal influenza vaccines [175] . The preliminary data from clinical trials of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine show evidence of immunologic priming to the novel H1N1 virus. The complex previous immunologic experience of humans with influenza viruses, either by prior infection or vaccination, cannot be emulated easily in experimental animals.The replication and virulence of pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses, compared to recent seasonal H1N1 human influenza viruses, were evaluated in ferrets [171, 172, 176] .']",The replication and virulence of pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses were evaluated in ferrets.,"The replication and virulence of pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses were evaluated through studies in animal models such as BALB/c mice and cynomolgus macaques.

202,"""What health risks are linked to international travel and migration, and how do they affect public health?""","[""). Air circulation patterns are laminar from overhead to near the floor. The sharing of air is thus reduced to very low levels beyond the same row and the two rows in front and in the back of a passenger.The most common infectious diseases on air travel are food borne. 41 outbreaks with 11 deaths have been reported between 1947 and 1999. The most common agents were Salmonella and Staphylococcus [25] .Global migration has risen to 191 million in 2005 [28] . In 2002, 40% of international air travellers leaving the US were travellers visiting friends and relatives. VFRs are prone to increased health risks: They are much less likely to seek pre-travel advice and their compliance with recommendations is worse, as they often have the misconception that they are less likely to acquire diseases such as malaria ''back home''. On average, they stay abroad for a longer time and they are more likely to travel with medical conditions, being pregnant and with small children. Living in close proximity with their relatives in low socioeconomic settings they are at higher risk for diseases like tuberculosis, typhoid fever and also malaria [29] . In a study assessing fever in returned travellers from the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network VFRs were more likely to develop fever after travel to sub-Saharan Africa, south-central Asia and Latin America. They were also more likely to suffer from a vaccinepreventable illness returning from Southeast Asia (OR 5.9; 95 CI, 2.9-11.9), south-central Asia (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0-5.1) and Latin America (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.6) [30] .Travellers are at increased risk to engage in sexual risk behaviour. Leaving the ''social control'' of the home country behind, making new acquaintances and maybe increased consumption of, e.g. alcohol might lower the threshold for sexual encounters with unknown partners. Reported rates of casual sexual experiences during travel vary from 5% to 51% [31] . In an Australian study only 34% of male travellers to Thailand stated not intending to have sex [32] . Men and women do not differ in their willingness to get to know new partners, but in their behaviour. Men more often pay for sex and, similarly to middle aged women, they are more likely to have sex with local partners. Younger women have sexual contacts more likely with fellow travellers and expatriates. Factors that are associated with a higher rate of casual sexual encounters in an individual include higher socioeconomic status, travelling alone or with people of the same gender, history of multiple sexual partners at home and repeated visits to a region [33] .More than 20 pathogens can be transmitted through sexual intercourse. The curable sexually transmitted infections can cause discomfort and they sometimes lead to serious complications, especially in women and small children. In addition they increase the risk for transmission of HIV up to 10 times. While incidence rates for gonococcal disease and Syphilis have remained stable in Western Europe, they have risen sharply in Eastern Europe during the 1990s [34] .Historically migration and global trade have resulted in pandemic spread of the plagues. Despite the fact that mainly tourism resulted in an exponential increase of the number of travellers, global mobility only rarely resulted in a huge public health impact. Lately, this was the case with HIV and SARS, which would have spread at a slower pace before jet age.In this highly mobile world, modern public health measures such as surveillance, early case detection and management, vaccination, information of the public and the travellers as well as facilitated access to medical services have replaced traditional quarantine in case of epidemic. Other measures such as thermal scanning in airports have not proved effective [35] . The legal frame of the IHR and global surveillance networks (check: GOARN) are additional means to stop the spread. However, we must all realize that there is no base for complacency.Particularly airborne infections transmitted before symptoms occur will travel before the patient realizes that he is a risk to community, and this will continue to create challenges to public health. This is illustrated annually by seasonal influenza in the northern and southern hemispheres."", ""Travel and public health\nsyndrome (SARS), a newly emerging respiratory infection caused by a novel coronavirus, the SARScoronavirus [1] . All but three of the cases could be linked to one index patient, a woman who had returned from Hong Kong in February. There she had stayed on the same floor of a hotel as a physician who had travelled from Guangdong province in southern China where several hundred cases of the then unknown respiratory illness had been detected in the preceding months [2] ( Figure 1 ). The effort to contain the epidemic in Toronto included the investigation of 2132 potential cases and the identification of 23103 contacts as requiring quarantine. The provincial government of Ontario calculated the costs for coping with the epidemic at C$1.13billion [3] . The tourism industry lost C$260 million following a World Health Organisation (WHO) advisory against travel to Toronto [4] . The above episode illustrates how a highly contagious infectious disease can spread through travellers around the world within days and how this can lead to considerable human and economic losses. Fortunately, such a disease does not necessarily lead to a secondary outbreak: In June 2008, a 40 year old Dutch woman visited two bat caves in south western Uganda. After her return home 3 weeks later she developed virologically confirmed Marburg fever. Isolation measures prevented any propagation of the disease in the Netherlands [5] .According to the World Tourism Organisation (WTO), international tourism has grown at an average rate of 7% a year between 2004 and 2007, reaching 903 million international tourist arrivals in 2007 [6] . Globalisation with increasing mobility of humans poses an ever-growing challenge to international public health. Among 784 American travellers to developing countries 501 (64%) reported at least one illness during their trip. The risk of falling ill was the lowest in Southern Africa and the highest in the Indian subcontinent [7] (Figure 2 ). The most common illnesses acquired during travel in the developing world are diarrhoea, malaria, influenza and dengue fever [8] (Figure 3 ). In contrast to short-term travel, international migration can lead to changes in the epidemiology of longer lasting diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV and Hepatitis B, reflecting the prevalence gap of these disorders between original and receiving country [9] . Thus between 1997 and 2002, two thirds of all heterosexually acquired HIV-Infections in 12 European countries were diagnosed in people from countries with generalised HIV epidemics [10] . Of particular concern are undocumented migrants, as by definition they have little access to medical care and are afraid to report any illness by fear of being Odds ratio for illness by destination in American travellers using a logistic regression analysis. 95% confidence intervals are indicated. Note: OR-values below zero indicate reduced risk of disease within the study cohort of travellers and not a protective effect of travel to these destinations. *p < .05. From ref.

They also may not only import infections occurring at home, but also others acquired during their odyssey [11] .In May 2005 the World Health Assembly adopted the revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR). The previous IHR were set up in 1969 with the purpose to monitor six different infectious diseases: cholera, plague, yellow fever, smallpox, relapsing fever and typhus. In view of newly emerging diseases such as viral hemorrhagic fevers, increasing cross-border travel and the lack of an internationally coordinated mechanism to contain international disease spread, the revision of this international agreement was initiated in the 1990s. The IHR (2005) are a set of rules that are legally binding on 194 countries around the world. They require that all countries strengthen their public health and surveillance capacities and that they notify WHO in case of a ''public health emergency of international concern'' which is determined as any event that ''constitutes a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and that potentially requires a coordinated international response''. In response WHO offers advice as well as technical and possibly financial support to meet these new obligations [12] .In addition to this intergovernmental approach of disease control and the national systems of infectious diseases surveillance, international clinician-based sentinel networks focussing on travellers such as ''GeoSentinel'' or ''TropNetEurope'' have been established. Their aim is to gather and distribute information about imported infectious diseases, thus allowing the update of travel recommendations. Sometimes, the diagnosis of a disease in a returned traveller can serve as a sentinel for a change in the epidemiological situation in the country of travel. In November 2004 an outbreak of falciparum malaria in the eastern Dominican Republic was detected through sentinel reports in Tropnet Europe and SIMPID, the associated European and German networks for surveillance of imported infectious diseases, as well as through three reports reaching CDC from the US and Canada. The information led to investigations and control measures in the Dominican Republic.

International networks like GeoSentinel and TropNetEurope help monitor and provide information on imported infectious diseases, allowing for the update of travel recommendations and early detection of outbreaks. In summary, international travel and migration can impact public health by facilitating the spread of diseases across borders, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to prevent and control infectious diseases.","
International travel and migration can pose health risks to individuals, communities, and public health systems. Some of the health risks associated with international travel and migration include:

1. **Infectious diseases**: Travelers can be exposed to infectious diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, and tuberculosis during international travel. These diseases can spread quickly through airports, bus stations, and other transportation"

In the absence of existing local capacity, identifying and supporting a local or international healthcare provider to take over NCD care after withdrawal is important. Vertical programming should be avoided. If the intervention was set up rapidly without clear objectives or handover strategy, a review process within the first year should be carried out. Depending on the findings, the project should be adapted to reflect any revised objectives and/or long-term plans, including integrating a moving on/handover strategy if the plan is to pull out after the crisis.Given the fact that NCD management in emergencies is not yet a routine part of humanitarian response, it is recommended to implement the suggestion of Slama et al. [4] for a comprehensive debriefing of all stakeholders, aiming to share lessons learned and increase preparedness for future emergencies. Accountability to beneficiaries needing lifelong care requires planning withdrawal from support of international organizations with adequate handover to local authorities and / or relevant health actors. In case the authorities fail to resume their responsibilities fully, potential interested organizations are approached to take over fully or partially the support of the provided services.As with episodic illnesses, NCDs may require the management of acute, life-threatening or uncontrolled conditions. However, a distinctive feature of these varied diseases is their need for continuity of care, including the detection and monitoring of disease progression (follow up care) and the management of long-term complications. This implies regular access to care, medicines, medical devices, and laboratory facilities for diagnosis and monitoring, and referral when necessary to specialized services. Patients should also be guided, supported and monitored for treatment adherence and side effects. Important secondary prevention activities (such as regular foot care in diabetes patients and aspirin after myocardial infarction) should be implemented as part of routine care, together with therapeutic education.The challenge in humanitarian contexts is the uncertainty of following up individuals for care and monitoring. This aspect should be regularly evaluated during the response to ensure the development and implementation of an adaptive follow-up system. This will ensure that patients are continuing to receive care independently of their mobility. Patients in transition, particularly those in migration, should have personalized contingency plans for their NCD management and patient-held records (see above 3.4 health information system). This can include provision of information about possible access points where they could consult along the way and/or provision of larger quantities of medication to cover the periods during which patients do not have access to a health facility or NCD medications.Follow-up care should be provided to all patients. However, as noted above, different risk profiles exist among patients with NCDs. Based on disease stability, complexity and risk of complications, the interval of follow up will change. Patients with uncontrolled NCDs or recovering from an acute condition may require visits monthly or more, whereas those with stable and controlled diseases may only require trimestral or bi-annual clinical review visits.NCD care and patient management strategies should be centered at the PHC level using the WHO PEN model [42], integrated with other health care services. The management of acute conditions beyond initial stabilization (e.g. dialysis, myocardial infarcts, or stroke) requires referral pathways to secondary and tertiary level care centers. These should be rapidly put in place, based on local availability and context. The initial needs assessment should provide the necessary information on which health services and transport systems are available locally. Supporting patients with out-of-pocket costsincluding transport -should be considered. Further guidance on referrals can be found in the UNHCR ""Principles and Guidance for Referral Health Care for Refugees and Other Persons of Concern"" [43] .Besides medical treatment, people with NCDs require information, education and tools to assist in the management of their NCDs. Therapeutic patient education promotes patient self-management and empowerment, both of which are key components of the management of any chronic conditions [44] . Topics such as health literacy, treatment adherence, medication side effects, and healthy lifestyles should be discussed, adapted to the context and patient. Patient education should be provided at each visit during the response. When resources are limited and in the early stages of the humanitarian intervention, health care providers can give standardized messages covering basic disease literacy and adherence advice. Later in the response, education can be expanded according to the patient\'s specific needs, potentially supported by other actors. For instance, community activities or NCD support groups are good avenues to deliver educative messages and can be done in collaboration with the community. Patient education is particularly important in the case of a mobile population where patients frequently change health services and providers. In addition, small booklets with pictograms and simplified explanations on treatment and recommendation for the next appointment could be used. Along with patient education, devices such as glucose meters are crucial for home and self-care management and adherence.Community engagement is key to NCD management, as it allows the identification of community needs, priorities and local capacity, understanding of the context, and proximity to']","Strategies needed for NCD care in humanitarian contexts include continuity of care, follow-up challenges, patient education, and community engagement.","Strategies needed for NCD care in humanitarian contexts should include ensuring continuity of care by providing access to comprehensive services and interventions from identification of the health condition to recovery.

120,What is the connection between cytokine storm and ruxolitinib in COVID-19 patients with hematological cancer?,"['2 in cytokine storm. Of interest an in-silico docking study found significant binding of kinase inhibitors like upadacitinib to the RNA dependent RNA polymerase kinase-like folded NiRAN domain. 135 JAKi most in use in hematology patients Ruxolitinib Ruxolitinib is a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor used for around 10 years in the clinics for the treatment of MPNs MF and PV.In general, hematological cancer patients exhibit enhanced mortality on SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with healthy individuals. 136 137 A cohort study in Wuhan on hospitalized hematological cancer patients showed an incidence of 10% that developed COVID-19 infection. While the incidence was relatively similar to that in healthcare providers (7%), the mortality rate of hematological patients (no MPN in the study) was increased to 62% vs 0% of healthcare providers, 138 estimated 41 times higher than hematological patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection. 139 Interestingly, a lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection was recorded both in China and elsewhere for BCR/ABL1 positive chronic myeloid leukemia. 137 140 However, no significant attenuation of T cell response was detected in MPN patients compared with healthy subjects. 141 Ruxolitinib was tested in several clinical settings, from one patient studies to phase 3 clinical trials (table 1, ClinicalTrials. gov). However, although a positive impression first came from case reports or small, uncontrolled or non-randomized cases series 142-148 that ruxolitinib might be helpful to fight COVID-19, these results were not confirmed in larger randomized trials. Press releases have been issued after the results of two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with the use of ruxolitinib in hospitalized non-ventilated patients (RUXCOVID, NCT04362137) and in ventilated patients (RUXCOVID-DEVENT, NCT04377620). Neither study met its primary endpoint. In the RUXCOVID study, 432 patients were enrolled. The results showed no improvement in the proportion of patients who experienced death, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit, by day 29 for patients receiving ruxolitinib 5 mg bidaily compared with those receiving standard of care alone (12.0% vs 11.8%; p=0.769). There was also no clinically relevant benefit in mortality rate by day 29 or in time to recovery.The phase 3 RUXCOVID-DEVENT study evaluated ruxolitinib 5 mg bidaily or 15 mg bidaily as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS on mechanical ventilation. There was no statistically significant improvement in mortality through day 29 compared with placebo. However, when US study participants were analyzed separately there was significance, as it also could be detected for the overall population when data from both treatment arms were pooled. The safety findings in both RUXCOVID and in RUXCOVID-DEVENT were consistent with those expected for ruxolitinib and for patients with COVID-19 infection.The development of ruxolitinib in the COVID-19 setting has not proceeded after these results 149 and ruxolitinib has not be retained by the WHO 128 or other drug agencies as a drug to be used in the setting of COVID-19.Many reasons could explain the fact that ruxolitinib, which has the same spectrum of JAKs inhibition as baricitinib, did not improve patients with COVID-19. One would be that BenevolentAI did not predict ruxolitinib as having a possible impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Furthermore, it is not clear if patients in the RUXCOVID and RUXCOVID-DEVENT trials were constantly on antiviral therapy. Nevertheless, coadministration of remdesivir with baricitinib in the COV-BARRIER trial concerned less than 20% of the patients and the placebo and test arms were appropriately balanced. 124 Hence, it is unlikely that it influenced the results of the study. Doses of ruxolitinib in the RUXCOVID trial were also lower than in most publications, but higher doses did not improve outcome in the RUXCOVID-DEVENT trial. As for the best time of intervention, no phase 3 study evaluated early treatment with ruxolitinib but both RUXCOVID and RUXCOVID-DEVENT studied different time of evolution of the disease and neither met its endpoint. Finally, best efficacy of baricitinib or tofacitinib is achieved in combination with corticosteroids, and such combination was not studied in a dedicated trial in the case of ruxolitinib. Once again however, publications mainly focus on trials with positive ending.

220,"How can we reduce the impact of mutations on antibody effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, considering viral escape and ADE?","['] . Although the frequencies of these mutations are low, and none has been found to be enriched in the current pandemic, these highlight that such mutations can potentially diminish or abolish the effectiveness of the currently available and in-developmentantibodies [66, 87] . Because spontaneously arising mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains can be positively selected, and ultimately become the dominant strain to achieve viral escape under pressure from a neutralizing antibody [88] [89] [90] [91] , strategies have been developed to protect against this. One strategy is to design broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the RBD because these are less likely to mutate [92] [93] [94] . Another method to combat potential escape mutants is to use a combination of several neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies in cocktails would target distinct epitopes, enabling an additive effect in potency. Indeed, such strategies have been employed for earlier outbreaks, as seen in Ebola (REGN-EB3) and SARS-CoV-1 (antibody cocktail of CR3014 and CR3022) [66] . These previous successes spurred Regeneron to start the development of a dual antibody cocktail for COVID-19 (REGN-COV2, a combination of two antibodies, REGN10933 + REGN10987; Table 1 ) [88, 89] . AstraZeneca has also confirmed a pair of mAbs (AZD8895 + AZD1061) that will be taken forward as a combination therapy, known as AZD7442, into clinical development (Table 1 ). It is anticipated that this cocktail strategy may be crucial in increasing the potency of antibodies for use against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutating strains.Antibodies represent a double-edged sword in that they can both neutralize and enhance viral infection [95] : highly potent neutralizing antibodies can recognize specific viral epitopes and block viral entry to the host cells, whereas poorly neutralizing antibodies can promote infection through a phenomenon known as ADE. ADE is seen in responses to many infectious diseases including dengue fever, in which the natural progression of the disease has been shown to utilize antibodies from the primary response to infection as a basis for increased severity in later secondary infections [96] . Similarly, poorly neutralizing antibodies or antibodies with low affinity can promote virus entry upon secondary infection, resulting in increased viral burden and more severe disease progression via ADE (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] . Mechanisms of ADE largely rely on the uptake of virus-antibody immune complexes into host immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes, a process that is mediated through interactions between the Fc domain on the antibodies and Fc receptor (FcR) on host cells. These virus-antibody immune complexes in turn initiate different downstream proinflammatory signaling pathways, leading to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased viral load (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] .ADE has previously been observed for antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 [100] [101] [102] . Upon rechallenge in SARS-CoV-1-vaccinated rhesus macaques, passive transfer of anti-spike IgG correlated with disease progression, as observed by the presence of severe diffuse alveolar damage and loss of disease tolerance [103, 104] . It was observed that the same antisera against SARS-CoV-1 may confer neutralization or enhancement based solely on the concentrations of the antisera employed where enhancement and neutralization occur at lower and higher concentrations, respectively [102] . Thus, a threshold dependent on both antibody concentration and affinity may need to be considered in aiming to confer neutralization instead of enhancement [103] .Convalescent plasma therapy for infectious diseases is also known to be more effective as a prophylactic if administered shortly after symptoms arise when viral titers are thought to be lower [31, 105, 106] , suggesting that the threshold of viral load is also an important factor to consider. Although to date (as of 28 July 2020) there have been no observations of ADE in antibodies currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 [107] , in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as two early clinical studies in China, showed that patients with severe disease frequently had an increased IgG response [108] [109] [110] . These accumulated data raise the possibility of ADE by antibodies in COVID-19, and close attention should be paid to the matter. In addition to antibody concentration/affinity and viral load, there are two other ways in which ADE can be avoided. Both involve the Fc, the interacting partner on the virus-antibody complexes that initiates ADE. Nanobodies lacking the Fc domain would potentially avoid the pitfall of ADE [111]']","Strategies to reduce the impact of mutations on antibody effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 include designing broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the RBD, using a combination of several neutralizing antibodies in cocktails to target distinct epitopes, and developing nanobodies lacking the Fc domain to avoid ADE.","To reduce the impact of mutations on antibody effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, considering viral escape and ADE, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Target Conserved Epitopes**: Design broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the virus, such as the RBD, which are less likely to mutate. This can help maintain the effectiveness of antibodies against different strains of the virus.

2. **Use Antibody Cocktails**: Utilize a combination of several neutralizing antibodies in cocktails. These antibodies can target distinct epitopes, providing an additive effect in potency. This strategy has been successful in other outbreaks like Ebola and SARS-CoV-1 and can help combat potential escape mutants in SARS-CoV-2.

3. **Employ Nanobodies Lacking Fc Domain**: Nanobodies devoid of the Fc domain can help avoid ADE while maintaining neutralizing effects. Although this may shorten the in vivo half-life, strategies like linking nanobodies to anti-human serum albumin can elongate their half-life.

4. **Introduce Fc Mutations**: Introduce specific mutations like the LALA mutation into the Fc domain of antibodies to minimize FcR activation and Fc-mediated toxicity, reducing the risk of ADE.

5. **Continuous Research and Development**: Constantly monitor and study the evolving mutations in SARS-CoV-2 to stay ahead of potential escape variants. This will require ongoing research to discover conserved functional neutralizing epitopes that can prevent the virus from mutating to evade antibodies.

By implementing these strategies, researchers can work towards reducing the impact of mutations on antibody effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, mitigating viral escape and ADE.","How can we reduce the impact of mutations on antibody effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, considering viral escape and ADE? ->: To reduce the impact of mutations on antibody effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, considering viral escape and ADE, several strategies can be employed:

5,What is the role of JAK2 and JAK3 inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19?,"[""BARRIER trials led to the FDA recommendation of baricitinib in certain settings of COVID-19 and its recommendation in U.S. NIH practice guideline for treatment of COVID-19. The same conclusison were reached by the expert committee of the WHO that recommends baricitinib in severe and criticial COVID-19 since the eighth version of its 'living guideline on drugs for COVID-19' from January 2022. Second, the JAK2 and JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib also got recommended by the U.S. NIH in case of baricitinib unavailability. However other alternative exists, such as IL-6 receptor blockers, which should be used in priority according to latest WHO guidelines.Ruxolitinib is the oldest JAKi on the market and the only one used in the hematological setting. It is often used in the treatment of MF and certain PV patients, and it was shown that on SARS-CoV-2 infection the inhibitor is generally not stopped and should be continued to control the MPN. It has been suggested that ruxolitinib may reduce immunopathological reactions as it does for GVHd. Although small non-controlled studies suggested some benefit for ruxolitinib in the treatment of COVID-19 and meta-analyses suggested a positive effect, the two randomized phase 3 studies failed to meet their primary endpoints, which led to suspension of ruxoltinib development program in the setting of COVID-19. The different outcomes between these RCTs and smaller studies point to the complexity of conducting clinical studies in patients with COVID-19. The outcomes may have been affected by differences in standards of care at different sites and in different regions at different times during the course of the pandemic. These standards of care include varying proportions of patients receiving corticosteroids, which has been shown to affect the outcomes for hospitalized patients. The studies also enrolled patients at different stages of COVID-19 and patients with more advanced disease may respond better to JAKi. Differences in outcomes between ruxolitinib and baricitinib in different studies may also reflect the doses used.The results on JAKi clinical use analyzed in several meta-analyses and in the studies detailed above suggest but do not prove a role for JAKi in COVID-19, as the only robust data are for an inhibitor that also exerts other effects than JAKi. Better designed trials with precisely controlled time of introduction of JAKi will be critical in the future. A favorable action of JAKi would be predicted by the mechanistic understanding of the COVID-19 immunopathology involving cytokines that require JAK1 for signaling. However, robust clinical confirmation is still needed. In principle, JAKi can be envisaged at times of development of cytokine storm but should not be used too early in COVID-19, as type I IFN signaling requires JAK1. Careful timing is required since pathological secretion of IL-6/IL-1 may occur in the same time-frame with the requirement for type I IFN action to clear the virus, and therefore JAKi may need to be associated with antiviral molecules.As more molecules keep being approved in emergency for treatment of COVID-19, RCTs are important to compare their definitive effect and determine the best indication(s) for each molecule. Also, RCTs with combination therapies would be all the more important for patient who might be already on treatment with JAKiwhich it might be dangerous to stop abruptly in an emergency situation.More data will emerge on secondary effects of JAKi in the setting of COVID-19. For example, both JAKi and COVID-19 were linked to potential thrombotic risk of their own but no evidence to date exist for an increased thrombotic risk while using JAKi for treating COVID-19. Moreover, adverse effects known from long-term treatment with JAKi, as immunosuppression, are less likely to be relevant in COVID-19, where treatment is of short duration, but should be kept in mind.Contributors SC, PG, PL and GL planned, wrote and reviewed review.Funding Funding to SC is acknowledged from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Fondation contre le cancer, Salus Sanguinis and Fondation 'Les avions de Sébastien', projects Action de recherché concertée (ARC) 16/21-073 and"", ' clinical improvement in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.The same overall conclusions were reported by a metaanalysis, 161 which examined two databases for RCTs in hospitalized patients, where patients were assigned to JAKi or standard of care. Pooling data from 4 such trials with 1338 subjects and treatment with either baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib and nezulcitinib. Treatment with a JAKi led to a significant reduction in the risk of COVID-19 death by 43%. 161 Although these meta-analyses provide a positive image on the efficacy of JAKi in COVID-19, there are several weaknesses. There is redundancy in the studies interrogated. Head-to-head comparisons of different inhibitors in similar settings was not performed. In addition, lack of systematic information on the timing of start of treatment and the variability of simultaneous glucocorticoid treatment further complicate interpretation.There are known adverse effects of the JAKi, which have been described in phase 3 clinical trials with ruxolitinib in MF and PV and then observed for other JAK2 inhibitors. [162] [163] [164] Given that JAK2 is essential for formation of red blood cells and platelets, anemia and thrombocytopenia can be induced by the use of JAK2 inhibitors. [162] [163] [164] In addition, given the involvement of JAKs in the immune response especially via IFNγ, reactivation of latent herpes simplex, zona-zoster, hepatitis B infections and tuberculosis are well known potential adverse effects. Several patients treated for MPNs with ruxolitinib developed aggressive B cell lymphomas. 165 Given that the timeframe of administration of JAKi is rather short (less than 30 days) in COVID-19 the expectation is that the effects reported after long-term use will not be detected.Several JAKi are being investigated for potential thrombotic risk. 166 This is apparently the case for tofacitinib and upacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor). 166 This issue is of great relevance given the thrombotic risk of COVID-19. Also, baricitinib should be examined for potential thrombotic risk. 167 In September 2021, FDA issued an updated warning about increased risk of serious heart-related events, cancer, bloot clots and death for JAKi that treat certain chronic inflammatory conditions. 168 This warning is based on a review of a large randomized safety clinical trial involving tofacitinib, but the warning has been extended to other JAKi treating such chronic inflammatory condition, such as baricitinib and upacitinib. This warning may not be relevant for treatment with JAKi in COVID-19 due to the short treatment duration, while the safety trial concerned chronic longer exposure to JAKi.A couple of potential adverse effects of JAKi including cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, as well as toxicity of combinations including JAKi have been reviewed in. 169 The coadministration, of either baricitinib or ruxolitinib, along with IL-6 inhibitors (eg, tocilizumab, siltuximab) could produce additive immunosuppression with possible severe bacterial or fungal infections. Ruxolitinib inhibits colchicine metabolism and this is relevant in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Favipiravir may enhance baricitinib exposure. In contrast, no adverse effects have been reported for simultaneous use of JAKi and remdesivir or dexamethasone.Although the pandemic situation seems to wear-off in western countries and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have led to limiting hospitalisations, predicting the future evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human population is difficult. Many questions remain concerning new outbreaks, evolution of the virus or how long protection following natural infection or vaccination will last. Therefore, the potential for drugs to treat people suffering from COVID-19 remains of interest.The major targets for inhibition in COVID-19 are the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunopathological phenomena triggered by the delayed cytokine storm inducing lung pathology and ARDS. Since cytokines act via JAKs, JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitors may emerge as potential useful therapeutic tools in the COVID-19 pathology. A JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib also inhibits the Numb Associated Kinase AAK1, which is involved in endocytosis of the virus. Hence baricitinib would act both via inhibiting the immunopathology and inflammation due to JAK1/JAK2 inhibition, but also via direct inhibition of virus entry and assembly due to AAK1 inhibition.

This is worrying for three reasons. First, it would be erroneous to assume that patterns of media reporting observed in the US are similar in Canada, with a recent study finding significant differences when comparing Canadian and US media reporting of Robin Williams\' suicide [27] . Second, the aforementioned research indicates that one-dimensional reporting of Veterans can perpetuate stereotypes and social distance; this can impede veteran reintegration into society, which has been identified as a policy priority in Canada [28] . Indeed, a large corpus of research indicates that media stereotyping of a group, for example people with mental illness or Veterans, can lead to increased levels of internal and external stigma [26, 29, 30] . Third, related research indicates that certain types of media reporting of suicide can lead to suicide contagion among demographically similar individuals−a phenomena known as the Werther effect [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .The Werther effect has been well-documented in many nations of the world [36] including Korea [37] , Austria [34, 38] , the US [31, 35] and Canada [39, 40] with a recent study indicating a 16% increase in Canadian suicides in the months following the death of Robin Williams [41] . Taken together, these studies indicate that the Werther effect is associated with various media-content related factors including (i) a focus on celebrity suicides; (ii) describing the suicide method in detail, especially asphyxiation and jumping; and (iii) sensationalized reporting of suicide.It is theorized that the Werther effect occurs because some vulnerable people may identify with the decedent and their struggles via social learning after consuming such media, which is intensified when the consumer perceives that the decedent is demographically alike (e.g. age and sex) and has a similar or elevated social status [31, 42, 43] . Such affinity, combined with sensational and detailed media coverage, may lead some vulnerable consumers to conclude that suicide is a feasible answer to ongoing struggles, leading to imitative suicidal behaviour [37, 41] .Conversely, the media can be a vector for increased awareness and education, such as pointing to available resources, highlighting stories of hope and recovery, and bringing attention to important social issues surrounding suicide [34, 40, [44] [45] [46] . Indeed, several research studies indicate a modest reduction in suicide mortality and suicidal ideation after suicide-related media reporting when the news focus has included content related to (i) mastery of crises; (ii) resilience in the face of adversity; and (iii) messages of hope and recovery [34, 39, 47, 48] This has been labelled \'the Papageno effect\' .Interestingly, several research studies, including two large-scale Canadian studies, indicate that media coverage of murder-suicides also leads to a reduction in suicide mortality, and is not associated with any Werther effect [39, 40] This may be because susceptible individuals tend not to identify with violent \'villains\' who ipso facto have a lowered social status and are typically presented unfavourably in the media [38] .Given this situation, the Mental Health Commission of Canada has sponsored the development and wide distribution of best practice guidelines to encourage the responsible reporting of mental health and suicide, known as Mindset, with the third edition published in 2020 [49] . These are available on a devoted website, and as a short booklet, with over 5000 distributed to journalists across Canada. Mindset includes bullet point lists of recommendations that attempt to guide the journalist to include protective information, while avoiding coverage that could lead to stigma and suicide contagion. For example, the third edition includes 16 bullet points related to writing about suicide including ""do not go into details about the method used"" and ""do tell others considering suicide how they can get help"", while there are seven mental illness bullet points including ""strive to include quotes from those affected or others like them"" and ""do not reinforce stereotypes (especially in headlines)"".Several studies have examined adherence to earlier editions of Mindset reporting guidelines in relation to generic media coverage of suicide and mental illness [45, 50] , but there has been little research examining Mindset in relation to Canadian Veterans. This lack of research is concerning, given the potential role of the media in influencing public stigma, as well as potentially contributing to the Werther effect and the Papageno effect.In an attempt to address this deficit, the overarching aim of this study is to assess the tone and content of Canadian media coverage of military Veterans, with a focus on PTSD and suicide. The first objective is to document and analyze common themes, content and temporal patterns in Canadian media articles about Veterans. The second objective is to examine common themes and content in the sub-set of articles which have PTSD as a theme. The third objective is to assess adherence to Mindset guidelines in the sub-set of articles which have Veteran suicide']",The media reporting can influence public stigma and the Werther effect in relation to mental health issues such as PTSD and suicide among Canadian Veterans.,"Media reporting can have a significant impact on public stigma and the Werther effect in relation to mental health issues like PTSD and suicide among Canadian Veterans.

143,How does primate self-medication knowledge contribute to human evolution and plant medicine understanding?,"[' (Dubost et al. 2019; Greene et al. 2020) .Possibly the most numerous studies have been conducted on non-human primates. This is particularly relevant for human evolution since humans and non-human primates share a common evolutionary history and have a similar physiology and it is possible that they share ways to combat diseases through medicinal plant use (Huffman 2016) . This includes studies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) (Basabose 2002; Cousins and Huffman 2002; Rogers et al. 2004; Huffman 2001 Huffman , 2003 Huffman , 2015 Huffman and Seifu 1989; Huffman et al. 1996; Mclennan and Huffman 2012; Krief et al. 2006; Masi et al. 2012) , Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) (Huffman et al. 2010; Tasdemir et al. 2020) , sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) (Carrai et al. 2003) , lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) (Peckre et al. 2018) , Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) , and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) (Morrogh-Bernard et al. 2017) . Some of these studies have demonstrated both health maintenance and deliberate self-medication that is processed using a combination of innate mechanisms, individual learning, and cultural transmission (Huffman 2016) . In all recorded cases, the plants used have been subjected to pharmacological analyses that have identified specific properties that correspond with the use of the plant. In addition to the use of plants in treatment, there are many examples of the use of foodmedicines, or medicinal foods, plants that are eaten as food, but that also contain important medicinal properties and therefore provide an underlying protection, with specific food items added in particular, in relation to parasite infection and reproductive events, though Huffman et al. (2020) have identified the use of Epimedium davidii Franch, Berberidaceae, potentially as a means of stress reduction in a preliminary study on Tibetan macaques. Icariin (10), a major prenylated flavonol glycoside, is the active principle associated with stress reduction and anti-depressant properties via downregulation of glucocorticoid receptor activity and regulation of hippocampal neuroinflammation (Li et al. 2015) .Chimpanzees display botanical knowledge when selecting plants (Janmaat et al. 2013 ) and also know the plant\'s location, when and how much to eat, the correct part of the plant and, at times, how to prepare it prior to ingestion (Huffman 2003; Cousins and Huffman 2002; Huffman and Seifu 1989; Huffman et al. 1996) . Of the 200-300 species of plant that they habitually use in their diet, at least 36 are medicinal (Huffman 2001) while some of the best studied self-medication practices in animals are in the way chimpanzees deal with intestinal parasites. Exhaustive study has demonstrated the use of two different methods, using plants that are not necessarily an everyday part of the diet (Huffman 2016; Huffman and Seifu 1989; Huffman et al. 1996 Huffman et al. , 2016 . Bitter pith chewing treats intestinal nematode infections and gastrointestinal problems while leaf swallowing addresses the problem of adult nodular worms and tapeworms (Huffman 2016) . In bitter pith chewing, the outer bark and leaves of the plant Vernonia amygdalina Delile, Asteraceae, are removed, the bitter juice contained in the inner pith is then chewed, and the remaining fibrous material is spat out. This member of the daisy family is not abundant and is searched out for consumption only when a chimpanzee is ill. Following the bitter pith chewing, chimpanzees invariably improve (Huffman and Seifu 1989; Huffman et al. 1996 Huffman et al. , 2016 . The biochemical properties of V. amygdalina consist of a range of medicinally useful chemicals while laboratory testing demonstrated the efficacy of the plant, which is also well known and used by local human populations for its medicinal properties as a treatment for intestinal parasites, stomach upsets and malaria (Huffman 2016) . Leaf swallowing involves the physical expulsion of worms through increased gut action (motility) which is caused by the selection and swallowing of whole, rough leaves (Huffman et al. 1996) . Leaves from over 40 different plant species are used; the main common property of the leaves is that they have silicate hairs that ""catch"" the worms. The leaves are eaten in a particular way, they are folded in the mouth and swallowed without chewing, normally on an empty stomach. This inhibits digestion and the leaves are normally flushed out, with attached parasites,', ' within 6 h (Huffman et al. 1996 .Though currently parasite expulsion is the best-known reason to self-medicate for many species, the diversity of bioactive components found in many plant items ingested suggests that a wide range of illnesses might be treated (Huffman 2001 (Huffman , 2003 Cousins and Huffman 2002; Krief et al. 2006; Masi et al. 2012) . Based on the assumption that anything a chimpanzee can do today was within the capabilities of the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor (McGrew 2010), the behavior of chimpanzees and bonobos is sometimes used to investigate aspects of human evolution (Hernandez-Aguilar 2009; McGrew 2010; Carvalho et al. 2012 ). This provides a broad evolutionary backdrop and context within which our ancestral use of medicinal plants sits comfortably; indeed, when viewed from an evolutionary perspective, it is inconceivable that hominins would have abandoned this very advantageous behavior and it is unlikely, given the constant battle against parasites and pathogens of all types that animals including humans experience, that they would have survived without the ability to treat at least some of these.A long-term study of Japanese macaques has recorded several instances of cultural transmission that illustrate how new behaviors are introduced into a group (Huffman et al. 2010) . As hominins spread into new environments, and as these environments changed with the huge climatic shifts that occurred in the Pleistocene, some knowledge will have been lost and potentially relearned, at times by copying animals (Huffman 2016) , while a combination of population-level neophobia-neophilia may have assisted in extending knowledge in new environments with unknown plants, as populations spread geographically and climates changed (Hardy 2018) . Cultural and social transmission is well established in some primate populations while there is a notable increase in specifically medicinal (and potentially poisonous) plants among humans at the start of the Neolithic (Fig. 4 ) most probably due to more extensive social networks (Hardy 2018) . Awareness of the value of animal self-medication practices has been recorded since antiquity (Álvaro et al. 2019 ) and there are many examples of humans copying animal behavior in the use of medicinal plants, following observation of sick animals (Huffman 2016) while Greene et al. (2020) outline shared knowledge of medicative plants between elephants and their mahouts. A recent example of the reverse, human-animal adaptation, has also been observed in the emerging use of soap by ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua) that live near a tourist complex on Ilha do Campeche, Brazil (Gasco et al. 2016) . A good example of human-animal correlation can be found in orangutans collecting leaves of Dracaena cantleyi Baker, Asparagaceae, that they mix with saliva and rub onto parts of the body, something that is also done by the local indigenous population, who rub a poultice of this plant on parts of the body to relieve pain (Morrogh-Bernard et al. 2017) .Dogs are the first animals to have been domesticated by humans, around 32,000 years ago. Since then, they have experienced similar environments. This has led to a set of overlapping genes including some involved in the digestion process, some involved in cancer development, and some involved in the neurological process (Wang et al. 2013) . Common genes are linked to aggressive behavior, depression, autism, and compulsive disorders, and dogs respond similarly to some anti-depressant drugs used to treat humans (Wang et al. 2013) .The very widespread use of medicinal plants among animals and the complex behavior associated with this supports the perspective that it is part of broad animal behavior with a long evolutionary pathway. The most likely scenario is that self-medication formed a part of the human evolutionary package and was carried throughout our long-term past. Assuming the same level of expertise among Paleolithic populations as is evident today in chimpanzees should be an absolute minimum in terms of self-medication practices and use of medicinal plants.The use of plant secondary compounds as medicine is widespread in animals, insects, and even birds and has been closely studied, in particular in non-human primate species. The extent of animal self-medication to combat parasites and in reproductive fitness suggests this evolutionarily advantageous behavior will also have been practiced by our direct hominin ancestors as an essential mechanism for survival rather than being a ""modern"" human development. Homo sapiens emerged in the Paleolithic and apart from some recent genetic adaptations (Liebert et al. 2017) , humans today are physiologically identical. Recent archeological evidence supported by historical and ethnographic data shows that a broad consumption of plants with both nutritive and medicinal compounds, in other words food-medicine, were and often still are one and the same in non-industrialized communities. In the West, the split between food and medicine that began in the Middle']","Primate self-medication knowledge contributes to human evolution and plant medicine understanding by providing a broad evolutionary backdrop and context for ancestral use of medicinal plants.

Primate self-medication knowledge has contributed to human evolution and plant medicine understanding in several ways:

1. **Evolutionary advantage:** Primates have evolved self-medication behaviors to cope with infections and diseases, which has provided an evolutionary advantage to their species.

For antigen preparation of pigeon type paramyxovirus (PPMV-1) R75/98 and vaccine type APMV-1 clone 30 purification was done accordingly, but virus was resuspended in PBS.Separation of NDV spike proteins was done as described by [40] . Briefly, the protein concentration of the purified virus was adjusted to 1.5 mg/mL in KCl-PBS before 0.1 mL Triton X-100 in PBS (20% (v/v)) was added, gently mixed and kept at room temperature (RT) for 20 min.

Again the pellet (p2) was kept for analysis after resuspension in 0.2 mL PBS.

Shortly, samples were diluted in sample buffer (Roti load ® (Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany)) heated at 100 °C for five minutes before adding 16 µL per lane into the gel pocket. Protein separation was conducted applying constant voltage setting (200 V) and the gel was either stained by Coomassie blue (Biorad, Hercules, California, USA) or proteins were blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham ™ Protran, Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) applying constant voltage setting (15 V) for 1.5 h.

137,What were the phase 3 clinical trial outcomes of ruxolitinib in COVID-19 patients and how do they relate to MPN patients with COVID-19?,"['2 in cytokine storm. Of interest an in-silico docking study found significant binding of kinase inhibitors like upadacitinib to the RNA dependent RNA polymerase kinase-like folded NiRAN domain. 135 JAKi most in use in hematology patients Ruxolitinib Ruxolitinib is a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor used for around 10 years in the clinics for the treatment of MPNs MF and PV.In general, hematological cancer patients exhibit enhanced mortality on SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with healthy individuals. 136 137 A cohort study in Wuhan on hospitalized hematological cancer patients showed an incidence of 10% that developed COVID-19 infection. While the incidence was relatively similar to that in healthcare providers (7%), the mortality rate of hematological patients (no MPN in the study) was increased to 62% vs 0% of healthcare providers, 138 estimated 41 times higher than hematological patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection. 139 Interestingly, a lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection was recorded both in China and elsewhere for BCR/ABL1 positive chronic myeloid leukemia. 137 140 However, no significant attenuation of T cell response was detected in MPN patients compared with healthy subjects. 141 Ruxolitinib was tested in several clinical settings, from one patient studies to phase 3 clinical trials (table 1, ClinicalTrials. gov). However, although a positive impression first came from case reports or small, uncontrolled or non-randomized cases series 142-148 that ruxolitinib might be helpful to fight COVID-19, these results were not confirmed in larger randomized trials. Press releases have been issued after the results of two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with the use of ruxolitinib in hospitalized non-ventilated patients (RUXCOVID, NCT04362137) and in ventilated patients (RUXCOVID-DEVENT, NCT04377620). Neither study met its primary endpoint. In the RUXCOVID study, 432 patients were enrolled. The results showed no improvement in the proportion of patients who experienced death, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit, by day 29 for patients receiving ruxolitinib 5 mg bidaily compared with those receiving standard of care alone (12.0% vs 11.8%; p=0.769). There was also no clinically relevant benefit in mortality rate by day 29 or in time to recovery.The phase 3 RUXCOVID-DEVENT study evaluated ruxolitinib 5 mg bidaily or 15 mg bidaily as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS on mechanical ventilation. There was no statistically significant improvement in mortality through day 29 compared with placebo. However, when US study participants were analyzed separately there was significance, as it also could be detected for the overall population when data from both treatment arms were pooled. The safety findings in both RUXCOVID and in RUXCOVID-DEVENT were consistent with those expected for ruxolitinib and for patients with COVID-19 infection.The development of ruxolitinib in the COVID-19 setting has not proceeded after these results 149 and ruxolitinib has not be retained by the WHO 128 or other drug agencies as a drug to be used in the setting of COVID-19.Many reasons could explain the fact that ruxolitinib, which has the same spectrum of JAKs inhibition as baricitinib, did not improve patients with COVID-19. One would be that BenevolentAI did not predict ruxolitinib as having a possible impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Furthermore, it is not clear if patients in the RUXCOVID and RUXCOVID-DEVENT trials were constantly on antiviral therapy. Nevertheless, coadministration of remdesivir with baricitinib in the COV-BARRIER trial concerned less than 20% of the patients and the placebo and test arms were appropriately balanced. 124 Hence, it is unlikely that it influenced the results of the study. Doses of ruxolitinib in the RUXCOVID trial were also lower than in most publications, but higher doses did not improve outcome in the RUXCOVID-DEVENT trial. As for the best time of intervention, no phase 3 study evaluated early treatment with ruxolitinib but both RUXCOVID and RUXCOVID-DEVENT studied different time of evolution of the disease and neither met its endpoint. Finally, best efficacy of baricitinib or tofacitinib is achieved in combination with corticosteroids, and such combination was not studied in a dedicated trial in the case of ruxolitinib. Once again however, publications mainly focus on trials with positive ending.

65,How do changes in lateral inhibition within thalamocortical circuits affect neuronal oscillations during visual processing in VSS patients?,"[' there is a final common pathway linking disorders of phantom perception, including e.g., migraine, tinnitus, neurogenic pain, and Parkinson\'s disease, 25 that slows the resting state alpha rhythm (8-13Hz) generated by the thalamus to just 4-7 Hz, 30 and is accompanied by an increase in gamma power due to changes in lateral inhibition within thalamocortical circuits. 25, 95 In our cohort of VSS patients, we did not observe any slowing of alpha rhythms measured from the cortex; however, we did observe functionally increased gamma-band power, potentially related to changes in E-I interactions. 27, 74, 81 Furthermore, our findings of reduced alpha-gamma PAC in VSS suggest that alpha-rhythms, typically generated by the thalamus, may become decoupled from gamma oscillations in the visual cortex. 25, 37 Interestingly, under the TCD framework, 25 if thalamic rhythms have slowed to 4-7Hz in VSS, the visual cortex may become preferentially entrained to the theta rhythm (i.e., increased theta-gamma PAC). However, in this study, the length of each trial was insufficient to accurately quantify theta-gamma coupling. 39 To further test the TCD framework, future work should focus on studying potential dysthymias directly within the thalamus and/or via thalamocortical connectivity. While, deep-brain structures like the thalamus are notoriously challenging to measure with noninvasive arrays of MEG sensors placed outside the head, 21 recent progress has shown that it is possible, 96 given certain constraints. 97, 98 However, in this study, the quality of the MEG-MRI co-registration, and the resulting forward model, were not good enough for reliably measuring subcortical activity. Therefore, future work should aim to utilise subject-specific 3D-printed scanner-casts and high-quality structural MRI scans in VSS cohorts.Our study is based on a relatively small number of VSS and control participants. Participant recruitment was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effect sizes of group differences should be considered: d = .738 for gamma power (which can be described as ""medium"" to ""large""); and d = 1.24 for the alpha-gamma PAC result (which can be described as ""very large""). This strengthens our confidence in the inferences drawn from the results.Future studies should replicate and extend our findings, focusing on characterising dysfunctional oscillatory activity in VSS, with even greater precision. Larger cohorts of participants would also allow neuroimaging findings to be directly related to the clinical symptoms of the condition, a crucial consideration given that VSS exists on a continuum with significant variances in the severity of reported symptoms. 1, 10 Finally, this study opted to use a high-contrast visual grating to elicit specific visual oscillations in the early visual cortex.However, it remains unclear whether our findings generalise to more complex perceptual stimuli. Interestingly, VSS patients report that certain stimuli trigger ""snow"" symptoms more than others. More naturalistic stimuli (e.g., images and videos) combined with MEG could be used to isolate which particular aspects of the visual world intensify VSS symptoms.Immersive virtual reality environments could also be used in combination with new wearable MEG systems. 99This study used MEG to study neuronal oscillations during visual processing in a cohort of visual snow syndrome (VSS) patients and control participants. Compared with controls, VSS patients displayed significantly increased gamma (40-70Hz) power in the primary visual cortex and reduced phase-amplitude coupling, suggesting that cortical activity in VSS during early visual processing is hyperactive and disorganised, results that are consistent with theories of thalamocortical dysrhythmia. ']","Our findings of reduced alpha-gamma PAC in VSS suggest that alpha-rhythms, typically generated by the thalamus, may become decoupled from gamma oscillations in the visual cortex.","Changes in lateral inhibition within thalamocortical circuits can affect neuronal oscillations during visual processing in VSS patients by potentially leading to increased gamma power due to alterations in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory interactions.

However, the only virus to be re-isolated from infected animals was A/duck/Guangxi/35/2001, and this virus was isolated from respiratory tract secretions and tissues and also from the spleen, liver and the heart. The Rhesus macaque model has been used to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of a candidate live attenuated cold-adapted H5N1 vaccine [113] . The vaccine virus derives its HA and NA from the clade 2.3 A/Anhui/2/2005 (H5N1) virus and the six internal protein genes from the cold-adapted A/AA/6/60 ca virus. The multibasic cleavage site in the HA gene was removed. Animals were inoculated intranasally with 10 7 EID 50 of the vaccine virus on days 0 and 28. Serum antibodies in the vaccinated macaques were detected by ELISA 2 weeks following the first dose, with an apparent boost after the second dose. Four weeks after the first dose of vaccine all animals had detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies in the serum. After the second dose of vaccine, HAI and neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of all the vaccinated animals. HAI and neutralizing titers against a heterologous H5N1 virus were two to fourfold lower than against the homologous virus. T cell responses, measured by IFN-g ELISPOT, were detected following the second dose of the vaccine. Three weeks after the second vaccination, the macaques were challenged intratracheally with 10 6 EID 50 of either the parent A/Anhui/2/2005 (H5N1) virus, or the A/bar headed goose/Qinghai/1/2005 (H5N1) virus. Control animals had symptoms of illness including anorexia, fever and loss of appetite from day 1 post-challenge. Four control animals were euthanized on day 3 post-challenge and the remaining 4 animals gradually recovered. None of the vaccinated animals exhibited any clinical signs of illness. Pathological changes in the lungs of the unvaccinated control animals were more severe than in the vaccinated animals, and viral antigen was only detected in cells of the control animals. Virus was not isolated from any organs of vaccinated animals, whereas high titers of virus were detected in the respiratory tissues of the control animals. Rudenko et al. described the evaluation of the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live attenuated cold-adapted vaccine virus, which is based on the low pathogenicity A/duck/Potsdam/86 (H5N2) virus, as a candidate vaccine against H5N1 in Java macaques [165] . This vaccine candidate is a 7:1 reassortant, and derives its HA from A/duck/Potsdam/86 (H5N2) and its NA and internal protein genes from the donor virus for the live attenuated influenza vaccines used in Russia, A/Leningrad/17/57 (H2N2). Monkeys vaccinated with two doses of the H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine virus, 21 days apart, did not exhibit signs of illness, and virus was recovered from 2 out of 4 animals, at titers between 10 1.2 and 10 4.2 EID 50 /ml between days 3 and 5 after the first dose. The dose of vaccine virus used was not reported. The H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine virus elicited only modest HAI responses in the vaccinated macaques. The animals were challenged with the HPAI A/chicken/Kurgan/02/2005 (H5N1) isolate. Vaccinated animals developed a fever, but it was of a lower grade and of a shorter duration than that observed in the control animals, and shedding of challenge virus occurred in vaccinated animals, but it was for a shorter duration than in the control animals. These data suggest that there may be a small protective effect of the H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine virus against heterologous H5 virus challenge, however, the numbers of animals used was small and the immune responses that were observed were not consistent between animals. The H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in small numbers of volunteers [166] . The vaccine was evaluated at two different dose levels, and two doses were found to be safe and immunogenic in 47-55% of subjects. HAI antibodies were detected in the serum of the vaccine recipients and IgA antibodies were detected by ELISA in nasal wash samples. Qualitatively, these responses were similar to those observed in the mouse model.

One such example is shown in Fig. 5(a) . This steric map corresponds to Glu35 of lysozyme at 10278 th femtosecond. There are significantly more (φ,ψ) values that are steric clash-free compared to the classical map. Interestingly, majority of the conformers with positive φ value are also steric clash-free. Also, several (φ,ψ) values close to φ ¼ 0 , which are usually disallowed due to severe clashes between carbonyl oxygen of i-1 residue and carbonyl carbon or carbonyl oxygen of ith residue, are now allowed. These clashes are avoided by subtle but acceptable adjustments to the backbone bond length and angle values Table 2 . As can be noted, all the bond lengths and angles concerned are within 5σ from ideal values, beyond which they are usually considered as outliers (Read et al., 2011) . The steric map may be viewed as a crude representation of van der Waals energy. In order to see how the map looks when energetic contributions from bonded interactions such as bond length and angle stretching, and also non-bonded interactions such as electrostatics and hydrogen bonding, are considered, we calculated the potential energy associated with every (φ,ψ) conformer of Glu35 at 10278 th femtosecond (see Materials and Methods for details on energy calculation). This energy map is shown in Fig. 5(b) . It can be seen that there is a good correspondence between the steric map and energy map. This shows that, apart from the van der Waals repulsion being minimal/absent in the steric clash-free regions of the steric map, the unfavorable energetic contributions from slightly deviant bond lengths and angles are not significant enough in majority of the (φ,ψ) regions.Another interesting phenomenon that can be seen in Supplementary Videos 1-5 is that some (φ,ψ) conformations which are disallowed due to steric clash at one time point say T1, becomes allowed (or) steric clashfree at a later time point, say T2.

231,"""What process describes random changes in environmental regimes in the SAIRS epidemic model?""","['THRESHOLD DYNAMICS OF SAIRS EPIDEMIC MODEL WITH SEMI-MARKOV SWITCHING\nStarting with the research of Kermack and McKendrick [13] , in the last century a huge amount of mathematical epidemic models have been formulated, analysed and applied to a variety of infectious diseases, specially during the recent Covid-19 pandemic.Once an infectious disease developed, the main goal is containing its spread. Several control strategies may be applied, such as detection and isolation of infectious individuals, lockdowns or vaccination. However, the detection of infectious individuals is far from being easy since they may not show symptoms. The presence of asymptomatic cases allows a wide circulation of a virus in the population, since they often remain unidentified and presumably have more contacts that symptomatic cases. The contribution of the so called ""silent spreaders"" to the infection transmission dynamics are relevant for various communicable diseases, such as Covid-19, influenza, cholera and shigella [12, 27, 19, 23, 1, 22, 20] ; hence, asymptomatic cases should be considered in such mathematical epidemic models.The containment of the disease with multiple lockdowns or isolation processes affects the transmission of the disease through the population. Moreover, in real biological systems, some parameters of the model are usually influenced by random switching of the external environment regime. For example, disease transmission rate in some epidemic model is influenced by random meteorological factors linked to the survival of many bacteria and viruses [24, 25] . Thus, the transmission rate as the ability of an infectious individual to transmit infection and also as expression of the contact rate between individuals can be subject to random fluctuations. Hence, the choice of fixed deterministic parameters in models is unlikely to be realistic. In epidemiology, many authors have considered random switching systems (also called hybrid systems), whose distinctive feature is the coexistence of continuous dynamics and discrete events (random jumps at points in time). In particular, many works consider regime switching of external environments following a homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain [7, 8, 14, 9, 28, 21] . The Markov property facilitates the mathematical analysis, although it can be a limitation as the sojourn time in each environment is exponentially distributed, which yields constant transition rates between different regimes. However, in reality, the transition rates are usually time-varying, hence, in each environmental state the conditional holding time distribution can be not exponential. For example, as shown in [24, 25] and reported in [15] , the dry spell (consisting of consecutive days with daily rain amount below some given threshold) length distribution is better modeled by Pearson type III distribution, gamma distribution or Weibull distribution. In this work, in order to include random influences on transmission parameters and overcome the drawback of the Markov setting, we use a semi-Markov process for describing environmental random changes. Semi-Markov switching systems are an emerging topic from both theoretical and practical viewpoints, able of capturing inherent uncertainty and randomness in the environment in many applied fields, ranging from epidemiology to DNA analysis, financial engineering, and wireless communications [30] . Compared to the most common Markov switching systems, they better characterize a broader range of phenomena but brings more difficulties to their stability analysis and control. Recently, a semi-Markov switching model has been used to analyze the coexistence and competitiveness of species in ecosystems [16] . In epidemiology, to the best of our knowledge, there are only very few semi-Markov switching models [15, 29, 4] and no one of these considers the role of the asymptomatic individuals in the disease dynamics. Thus, in this paper, we want to fill this gap and improve our understanding of these types of hybrid systems.Precisely, we study a SAIRS-type model with vaccination, where the total population N is partitioned into four compartments, namely S, A, I, R, which represent the fraction of Susceptible, Asymptomatic infected, symptomatic Infected and Recovered individuals, respectively, such that N "" S`A`I`R. The infection can be transmitted to a susceptible through a contact with either an asymptomatic infectious individual, at rate β A , or a symptomatic individual, at rate β I . Once infected, all susceptible individuals enter an asymptomatic state, indicating a delay between infection and symptom onset if they occur. Indeed, we include in the asymptomatic class both individuals who will never develop the symptoms and pre-symptomatic who will eventually become symptomatic. From the asymptomatic compartment, an individual can either progress to the class of symptomatic infectious I, at rate α, or recover without ever developing symptoms, at rate δ A . An infected individuals with symptoms can recover at a rate δ I . We assume that the recovered individuals do not obtain a long-life immunity and can return to']",A semi-Markov process describes random changes in environmental regimes in the SAIRS epidemic model.,A semi-Markov process describes random changes in environmental regimes in the SAIRS epidemic model.,"""What process describes random changes in environmental regimes in the SAIRS epidemic model?"" ->: A semi-Markov process describes random changes in environmental regimes in the SAIRS epidemic model.","

31,How does complement activation contribute to the development of malignant pleural effusion?,"['Recruitment of IL-1β-producing intermediate monocytes enhanced by C5a contributes to the development of malignant pleural effusion\nMalignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common and disabling complication of cancer, with one-sixth of patients with malignancy reported to develop effusions during the course of disease. 1 Approximately 75% of pleural malignancies are caused by lung cancer, breast cancer, or leukemia. 2 As the second most common exudative pleural effusion, however, very little information is available on the immune mechanisms involved in the development of MPE. Previous studies have shown an increased number of CD4 + helper T lymphocytes in MPE, and further revealed that the underlying mechanism is inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which mediate the differentiation and recruitment of CD4 + T cell subtypes in the pleural cavity. [3] [4] [5] As effector cells of innate immunity, CD14 + monocytes are associated with an inadequate response to chemotherapy in small cell lung cancer. 6 In squamous cell lung cancer, the infiltrated monocytes highly express factor XIIIA, which promotes lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis. 7 However, the role of monocytes in the development of MPE has not previously been investigated.Human blood monocytes are broadly classified into three subsets: ""classical"" CD14 ++ CD16 À monocytes responding to CCL2 and CCL7, which signal through CCR2; ""nonclassical"" CD14 + CD16 + monocytes expressing CX3CR1, which pairs with CX3CL1; and ""intermediate"" CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes which share the features of both classical and nonclassical monocytes and express CCL2, CCL7 and CX3CL1. 8 Chemokines binding to their receptors can induce the recruitment of monocytes to sites of infection. It has been well documented that an accumulation of monocytes is associated with poor prognosis in cancer, 6, 7 but the subtype distribution and mechanism of infiltrated monocytes subtype in MPE are poorly elucidated.As a modulator and effector of innate immune responses, complement activation not only provides protection against pathogens but also participates in tumorigenesis. 9 Complement activation via the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways generates multiple effector molecules, including C5a, which induces monocyte and neutrophil chemoattraction and activation by binding to C5aR. 10, 11 Complement activation has been implicated as a driver of tumor growth and metastasis in the tumor microenvironment. 12 The expressions of C3, C5, C1q, and factor H are increased in lung and breast cancer. [13] [14] [15] [16] C5a is involved in tumor immune mechanisms and promotes tumor cell growth in solid tumors, such as lung, colon, and breast tumors. 17 Blockade of the C5a-C5aR1 axis can impair lung cancer bone metastasis and the growth of gastric cancer in mice. 18, 19 Additionally, C5a has been reported to induce A549 cell proliferation, which plays a vital role in the development of lung cancer. 20 However, little is known about whether the activation of the complement system, especially C5a, is involved in the development of MPE.Our previous study found that complement effector C5a not only enhanced the activation of nonclassical monocytes through cytokine release (IL-1β, IL-17 and IL-27), but also promoted the recruitment of nonclassical monocytes to the pleural cavity through CCL2, CCL7 and CX3CL1. 21 However, the relationship between C5a and monocytes in MPE is still unclear. In this study, we explored the distribution and phenotypic characteristics of monocytes, the activation of the complement pathway, the possible mechanism of monocyte recruitment into the pleural space, and the potential role of C5a and IL-1β-producing intermediate monocytes in the development of MPE.Overall, we demonstrated that C5a promoted the infiltration of intermediate monocytes to the pleural space by enhancing CCL2 production in PMCs. C5a also induced IL-1β release from the recruited monocytes. The accumulated C5a and IL-1β in MPE promoted the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung cancer cells, which contributes to the development of MPE.The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China. All the enrolled patients signed informed consent forms.

The bill, it did not pass in the end, but it showed everyone we were capable, we were close (Participant 25).In relation to mobilization outcomes, both coalitions have experienced success in defining the depth and extension of the housing problem and have gained prominence as political forces by raising awareness and proposing policy changes. RTR has brought legislation to parliament and has also pushed most of the political parties to adopt more rightful positions on the housing issue. While effective in pushing for reforms in housing legislation and in bringing together a wide range of organizations, RTR has been less effective in achieving reforms in housing legislation and in building a mass housing movement. MEL seems to be less successful in legislative terms as well. Yet, MEL was able to create a more cohesive housing movement than RTR. MEL has also been more effective in building a movement with a high level of cohesion and has been able to expose the vulnerabilities in the Portuguese housing system. Hence, it is possible to say these two case studies have produced favorable outcomes.This study analyzed the relationship between outcomes and the mechanisms which sustain coalitions. The paired comparison of Dublin and Lisbon offers important insights into how two major contemporary housing coalitions overcame challenges, how they interacted and how they cooperated to sustain alliances. In addition, the indepth analysis of the case studies adds to our understanding on the features of coalitions in terms of their differences and similarities. The more varied the groups in the coalition, the harder it is to create consensus. While there are many challenges in coalition building, the coalitions analyzed have been able to stimulate cross-cutting cleavage participation. Their broad representation has translated into both legitimacy and political clout for the coalitions.Social movements rely on coalitions to mobilize the large numbers of people necessary for success (van Dyke and Amos 2017) . Nevertheless, it is also well known that such collaborations are hard to create and maintain due to ideological disputes, tactical disagreements and the lack of previous ties. In the case studies, the creation of an interorganizational environment was spurred by a specific political threatthe worsening of housing conditions in both Dublin and Lisbon. This was a powerful incentive for collective action, as groups started negotiating around political differences. An important dynamic for the formation of the coalitions was that both organizations employed good political timing, as their experienced members recognized the opening for political pressure and media visibility, coupled with the cooperation of ""bridge builders"" and a unified narrative against the housing crisis. This process of connection and interaction are crucial to coalition formation (van Dyke and Amos 2017) showing that conducive organizational structures are key to coalition formation.With diverse membership and a wide range of interests in support of a common political agenda, the coalitions faced challenges. Maintaining coalitions with such a variety of actions is one of the main challenges for coalition sustainability and longevity. RTR and MEL members were, nonetheless, capable of overcoming most of those challenges. Even if they are not perfectly cohesive and though they face internal frictions around tactical decisions-since some organizations pay a higher cost than others if the coalition fails-the coalitions are active in many ways. The research found that a broad ideology coupled with respect for political differences has helped overcome differences and allowed coalition members to sustain their political identities and find ways to collaborate, as also shown by Enriquez (2014) and Staggenborg (1986) .Housing mobilization in Dublin and Lisbon provides an interesting comparison for analyzing the links between the mechanisms and outcomes that sustain coalitions. More importantly, the study has shown that coalitions increase their capacity to collaborate and sustain their coalition agreement by implementing tactical approaches which allow for group members to keep their identities and dissipate dissent through a tolerance for differences. In relation to outcomes, it has been found that the housing coalitions were successful in attracting visibility to the housing crisis, but so far, their policy results have been somewhat limited. The analysis has shown that more structured coalitions that include political parties as institutional allies have been more successful in pushing for reforms in housing legislation, but they lack inclusivity when it comes to minority groups. In Dublin, minority groups tend to organize outside RTR, in more horizontal and loosely organized housing groups, such as the IHN. These groups have been unable to find a common approach, which has led to fragmentation rather than cooperation among housing movements (Lima 2021) . In Lisbon, MEL and', "" its associated members have helped to put the right to housing on the public and political agenda (Mendes 2020) . Being more concerned with the inclusion of vulnerable groups and minorities than RTR, MEL's less formal structure has produced better outcomes in relation to the mobilization of the most vulnerable groups. These two study cases were relevant in order to explore how the structure and form of coalition activism affects outcomes. While both MEL and RTR were successful in placing the housing crisis in the public eye, turning it into a political issue, concrete policy changes are still difficult to achieve.This thumbnail comparison of housing coalitions contributes to the literature on social movement coalitions and housing studies by analyzing the internal dynamics of cooperation in coalitions and the outcomes of social movement collaborations. In the particular field of housing, coalitions have informed and educated people about the origins of the housing crisis and denounced the impacts of this crisis. This article was written before the global Covid-19 outbreak, and since then the housing coalitions analyzed here are likely to have changed and achieved different results, such as the approval of emergency legislation to ban evictions and foreclosure during the Covid-19 pandemic. Further studies might well be conducted in order to revisit these coalitions and see if they still exist and/ or expand after the pandemic; and if they do not, it is important then to understand what has led to their demise.""]","The housing coalitions in Dublin and Lisbon were successful in attracting visibility to the housing crisis, but their policy results have been somewhat limited.

The mummified body of a 4500-year-old man, thought to be around 40-50 years old when he died, was found in 1991 in the Italian Alps (Gaber and Künzel 1998) . Nicknamed Ötzi, he had multiple pathologies, including periodontitis, healed rib fractures, intestinal parasites, and gall stones. He also had some degenerative joint disease, mild osteoarthritis, and a healed broken rib as well as several peri-mortem injuries (Zink et al. 2019 ). Sixty-one tattoos in nineteen groups were found on his body (Samadelli et al. 2015) , all related to known acupuncture points suggesting preventative medicinal measures, while fragments of plants, including the bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, Dennstaedtiaceae (treatment: intestinal parasites), several mosses including Sphagnum imbricatum Hornsch. ex Russow., Sphagnaceae (treatment: wound dressing) and fungi like birch polypore, Piptoporus betulinus (Bull.) P. Karst., Fomitopsidaceae (anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties) were found either as part of his equipment or in his stomach and are thought to have been used as medicines (Zink et al. 2019 ). The very detailed study of this mummified individual has provided a unique insight into the extent of both preventative and curative medicine from the Bronze Age (Fig. 5) .One of the earliest sites in the American continent is Monte Verde, in Chile, that was occupied from at least 18,500-14,500 years ago (Dillehay et al. 2015) . This site has a large assemblage of carbonized plants, of which a significant number, including several species of seaweed, are thought to have been collected for their medicinal properties while the remains of a structure are thought to be a medicinal hut (Dillehay 1997 , Dillehay et al. 2008 , Dillehay et al. 2015 . Traces of the medicinal San Pedro cactus, Echinopsis pachanoi (Britton & Rose) Friedrich & G.D. Rowley, Cactaceae, were found at Guitarrero Cave, Peru, and dated to around 10,000 years ago (8600-5600 BC; Lynch 1980) . Medicinal uses including treatment for ulcers, wounds, inflammation acne, and fortifying hair have been recorded ethnographically (Bussmann and Sharon 2006; Paniagua-Zambrana and Bussmann 2020) , and it also has hallucinogenic properties (Guerra-Doce 2015) due to its high content of mescaline (7), a protoalkaloid of the substituted phenethylamine class. Reinhard et al. (1991) developed the use of pollen extracted from human coprolites to develop studies of paleopharmacology from North and South American archeological sites. The use of pollen as evidence of deliberate plant ingestion is complex, since it occurs as ""rain"" and can be environmental; however, high concentrations are suggested to indicate intentional consumption (Reinhard et al. 1991) . Using this method, several studies of prehistoric and pre-Hispanic populations in the American continent have identified possible ingestion of a range of medicinal plants, sometimes in association with evidence for intestinal parasites. Examples include sites in North America (Reinhard et al. 1991 ) (Ephedra sp., Larrea sp., Salix sp.; Sobolik and Gerick 1992, Ephedra sp., Prosopis sp.), and South America, including Furna do Estrago, Pernambuco State, Brazil (several plants including Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart.) Coville, Fabaceae, or barbatimão) and a range of genera including, Sida sp., Sebastiania sp., and Fevillea sp. (Teixeira-Santos et al. 2015) and Pedra Furada, in the State of Piauí, Brazil, where twelve taxa from genera that include medicinal plants were identified (de Miranda Chaves and Reinhard 2006) . The low levels of the otherwise very common intestinal parasites Ascaris lumbricoides (giant roundworm) and Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) in some South American prehistoric populations have led to the suggestion that this may be due to the use of medicinal plants (Leles et al. 2010) .Some of the earliest texts known concern medical practices']","The mummified body of a 4500-year-old man, thought to be around 40-50 years old when he died, was found in 1991 in the Italian Alps.

28,What is the correlation between anti-RBD IgG AUC and the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2?,"[' to understand antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. Thirty-four subjects (18.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, or had known recent close contacts but were not tested due to early limited testing availability. Those diagnosed with COVID-19 were separated into two groups, those infected in March 2020 (14 people) and those infected in the second wave of infections starting in July 2020 (20 people). Data concerning the local COVID-19 outbreak is publicly available: https://www.healthygallatin.org/coronaviruscovid-19/, accessed on 31 May 2021. Ten out of the remaining 134 participants were not diagnosed with COVID-19 and had no known contacts, yet had detectable antibody titers. Participants indicated their disease severity on a scale of 0-3 from asymptomatic to severe. The breakdown of antibody detection and disease severity of these participants is presented in Table 1 . We determined that most volunteers with unknown COVID-19 diagnosis or interactions (124/134 or 92.5%) were negative for COVID-19 antibodies. Twenty-seven people included in our study self-reported an illness in the 6-month period prior to antibody testing; of these only 4 had IgG AUC levels above the cutoff. Thus, despite many being anecdotally ""sure"" that they had contracted the virus in January or February before COVID-19 was detected and testing was available regionally, most were anti-RBD IgG negative. Clearly, in addition to COVID-19, there were severe cold strains and flu circulating in our community early in 2020. Our small surveillance study determined that a person with no known exposure or diagnosis was very unlikely to have COVID-19 antibodies.The majority of participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had detectible IgG titers (85.3%, 29/34 people). Thus, a small fraction (14.7%, 5/34) of confirmed positive COVID-19 diagnosed participants did not have detectible IgG levels. The mismatch between COVID-19 diagnosis and antibody titers occurred for the first time in August 2020 and then occurred four more times during the increase in COVID-19 cases in our county in the fall of 2020. Furthermore, the AUCs for these people were far below the cutoff. These data suggest either an increased detection of asymptomatic confirmed positive participants that failed to elicit detectible antibody responses or the possibility of increasing misdiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection that occurred during the increase in testing in the fall of 2020. Volunteers with positive ELISA titers were invited to donate serum samples monthly for up to 12 months post-infection, regardless of their COVID-19 diagnosis. RBD-specific antibodies were measured more than once in most participants and were maintained in the majority of participants for 5 months when detection began to wane, with only about 50% of subjects maintaining antibody titers for more than 6 months (Figure 2A,B) . Of the 15 people that had antibody assessments monthly for greater than 6 months, only 6 had antibody titers that lasted longer than 6 months. Clearly, those participants with sera collections starting in July lost antibody titers sooner and thus were assessed for a much shorter duration. Alternatively, a few of the individuals with detectible titers did not return for sampling. There were no notable differences in self-reported disease severities between those infected in March, compared to those infected in July or later. Too few ill participants were enrolled to generate a correlation between disease severity and antibody levels. We measured the highest starting titers in participants that were infected in March and found a strong correlation between antibody levels detected initially and the duration of the measurable antibody response ( Figure 2C ). Infections that occurred in July or after resulted in significantly lower starting antibody levels ( Figure 2D ). Expanded testing and contact tracing at this later time may have increased the diagnosis of more very mild or asymptomatic infections compared to March. The IgG AUC of participants with no known infection or interaction also appeared lower but was not significantly different from the other groups.We measured the capacity for collected sera to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 for both those infected in March ( Figure 3A ) and those infected in July and after ( Figure 3B ). These assays were performed in BSL-3 containment with serum samples that were not inactivated with 1% Triton-X100 and the neutralization titers are reported as the inverse of the serum dilution that provided 50% protection of the monolayer. There was a correlation between anti-RBD IgG AUC and the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3C) . Thus, the results suggest that anti-RBD IgG AUC is a valid predictor of the capacity of serum to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, confirming the findings in earlier studies [15, 26] . However, serum from one']",There is a correlation between anti-RBD IgG AUC and the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.,"The correlation between anti-RBD IgG AUC and the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 is strong, as indicated in the study.

42,What is the cytokine response to β-coronaviruses compared to other viruses?,"[' we first assessed how comparable the number of different cytokines measured in these studies was across the five CRS-causing viruses. Figure 2 shows how variable this number is between virus-specific studies (e.g., 15 for H5N1 and 26 for SARS-CoV-2). This variation reflects (i) the increasing interest developed for CRS-causing pathologies over recent years (26 recent studies reported cytokine measurement for SARS-CoV-2 against only 10 H5N1-related studies) and (ii) the increased availability and sensitivity of the multiplex detection method.The influenza A viruses trigger an increase in all cytokine levels measured (Figure 2 , yellow). In contrast, during infection with each of the β-coronaviruses, some cytokines were detected at levels normally found in control groups (blue). This indicates that β-coronaviruses can subvert the immune response, reflecting different kinetics and pathogenesis between the influenzaand coronavirus-associated diseases. Of note, studies of H5N1 infections showed that a few cytokines were increased compared with control groups, and no change was observed in other studies (36, 52) , illustrating the greater complexity of these diseases, probably due to the multifactorial nature of the mechanisms involved. Table 1 shows the number of cytokines whose levels are increasing in one, two, three, four or all five virus-related infections from the interrogated literature. Only five cytokines were modulated regardless of the virus-associated disease concerned, with 20 other cytokines being shared to some degree. Increased levels observed in 16 cytokines were unique to a single virus at a time. It is important to keep in mind that the amplitude of change in the cytokines is not considered, which can be different between the different diseases, adding to the heterogeneity of those severe respiratory infectious diseases. This backs up the highly complex nature of the associated diseases as well as the past and current struggles to develop efficient vaccines and treatments.To examine the presence of the measured cytokines and directionality of their change, we constructed a heatmap of the included viruses and cytokine responses.The Cytokine Response to SARS-CoV-2 Sits in Between the Ones Given to Other β-coronaviruses and Influenza A VirusesWe used a hierarchic clustering algorithm on the viruses using Jaccard distance and complete linkage, clustering them based on the cytokine responses they cause. The method groups the pathogens in three clusters. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV comprise the coronavirus cluster, and H5N1 and H7N9 form the influenza cluster, while SARS-CoV-2 sits in an individual cluster (Figure 3) , slightly closer to the two influenza A viruses than to the two β-coronaviruses.The cluster analysis of cytokines defines eight clusters, based on the direction of their modulation upon infection with each virus. It is important to note that the results of this cluster analysis are biased by the missing information for some cytokines. Bearing this in mind, it is worth looking into the detailed patterns of cytokine responses of the various CRS-inducing viruses. The cytokine cluster I includes the pro-inflammatory, TNF-α, and two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-2 and IL-10. All of them had mixed results in SARS-CoV-2, while encompassing all three categories of results for the other two coronavirus infections, which were predominantly increased during influenza infections. Unfortunately, cluster II seems to be restricted to cytokines measured only in H7N9-mediated infections, preventing us from comparing influenza A viruses vs. with β-coronaviruses. Clusters III and VI carry the generally increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are elevated for almost all of the viruses but not measured in all of the cases of cluster VI. Among those cytokines are IFN-α and IFN-γ, typical representatives of the general antiviral response (type-I and type-II IFNs), as well as IL-6, one of the most prominent pro-inflammatory cytokines, along various chemokines. Cytokines from Cluster IV measured during coronavirus infections do not fluctuate, while most of them are elevated during an influenza infection, e.g., IL-4 and IL-5 upon H7N9 infections. IL-4 is involved in Th2 differentiation, and the Th2 cells can produce IL-5 to mitigate eosinophil infiltration (53) . Such differences observed between virus-specific pathologies reflect the strong alterations observed in coronavirus infections, particularly SARS-CoV-2 (54) . The cytokines in Cluster VII and VIII do not always respond to SARS-CoV-2: IL-15 and CCL5 (RANTES) are not elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection. IL']",The cytokine response to β-coronaviruses is different compared to other viruses.,"The cytokine response to β-coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sits in a cluster by themselves, slightly closer to the cytokine response seen in influenza A viruses than other β-coronaviruses. The cytokine response to influenza A viruses tends to trigger an increase in all measured cytokine levels, while β-coronaviruses show some cytokines detected at levels normally found in control groups, indicating they may subvert the immune response in a different way. The type-I IFN response to β-coronaviruses is active, with variations in the levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ, whereas the response to SARS-CoV-2 is different, with a weak or no induction of type-I IFNs.","What is the cytokine response to β-coronaviruses compared to other viruses? ->: The cytokine response to β-coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sits in a cluster by themselves, slightly closer to the cytokine response seen in influenza A viruses than other β-coronaviruses.

132,How has international tourism affected global public health in terms of infectious disease spread and international health regulations?,"[""Travel and public health\nsyndrome (SARS), a newly emerging respiratory infection caused by a novel coronavirus, the SARScoronavirus [1] . All but three of the cases could be linked to one index patient, a woman who had returned from Hong Kong in February. There she had stayed on the same floor of a hotel as a physician who had travelled from Guangdong province in southern China where several hundred cases of the then unknown respiratory illness had been detected in the preceding months [2] ( Figure 1 ). The effort to contain the epidemic in Toronto included the investigation of 2132 potential cases and the identification of 23103 contacts as requiring quarantine. The provincial government of Ontario calculated the costs for coping with the epidemic at C$1.13billion [3] . The tourism industry lost C$260 million following a World Health Organisation (WHO) advisory against travel to Toronto [4] . The above episode illustrates how a highly contagious infectious disease can spread through travellers around the world within days and how this can lead to considerable human and economic losses. Fortunately, such a disease does not necessarily lead to a secondary outbreak: In June 2008, a 40 year old Dutch woman visited two bat caves in south western Uganda. After her return home 3 weeks later she developed virologically confirmed Marburg fever. Isolation measures prevented any propagation of the disease in the Netherlands [5] .According to the World Tourism Organisation (WTO), international tourism has grown at an average rate of 7% a year between 2004 and 2007, reaching 903 million international tourist arrivals in 2007 [6] . Globalisation with increasing mobility of humans poses an ever-growing challenge to international public health. Among 784 American travellers to developing countries 501 (64%) reported at least one illness during their trip. The risk of falling ill was the lowest in Southern Africa and the highest in the Indian subcontinent [7] (Figure 2 ). The most common illnesses acquired during travel in the developing world are diarrhoea, malaria, influenza and dengue fever [8] (Figure 3 ). In contrast to short-term travel, international migration can lead to changes in the epidemiology of longer lasting diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV and Hepatitis B, reflecting the prevalence gap of these disorders between original and receiving country [9] . Thus between 1997 and 2002, two thirds of all heterosexually acquired HIV-Infections in 12 European countries were diagnosed in people from countries with generalised HIV epidemics [10] . Of particular concern are undocumented migrants, as by definition they have little access to medical care and are afraid to report any illness by fear of being Odds ratio for illness by destination in American travellers using a logistic regression analysis. 95% confidence intervals are indicated.

They also may not only import infections occurring at home, but also others acquired during their odyssey [11] .In May 2005 the World Health Assembly adopted the revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR). The previous IHR were set up in 1969 with the purpose to monitor six different infectious diseases: cholera, plague, yellow fever, smallpox, relapsing fever and typhus. In view of newly emerging diseases such as viral hemorrhagic fevers, increasing cross-border travel and the lack of an internationally coordinated mechanism to contain international disease spread, the revision of this international agreement was initiated in the 1990s. The IHR (2005) are a set of rules that are legally binding on 194 countries around the world. They require that all countries strengthen their public health and surveillance capacities and that they notify WHO in case of a ''public health emergency of international concern'' which is determined as any event that ''constitutes a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and that potentially requires a coordinated international response''. In response WHO offers advice as well as technical and possibly financial support to meet these new obligations [12] .In addition to this intergovernmental approach of disease control and the national systems of infectious diseases surveillance, international clinician-based sentinel networks focussing on travellers such as ''GeoSentinel'' or ''TropNetEurope'' have been established. Their aim is to gather and distribute information about imported infectious diseases, thus allowing the update of travel recommendations. Sometimes, the diagnosis of a disease in a returned traveller can serve as a sentinel for a change in the epidemiological situation in the country of travel. In November 2004 an outbreak of falciparum malaria in the eastern Dominican Republic was detected through sentinel reports in Tropnet Europe and SIMPID, the associated European and German networks for surveillance of imported infectious diseases, as well as through three reports reaching CDC from the US and Canada. The information led to investigations and control measures in the Dominican Republic.

International clinician-based sentinel networks like ''GeoSentinel'' and ''TropNetEurope'' have been established to gather and distribute information about imported infectious diseases, aiding in updating travel recommendations and detecting outbreaks, as seen in the case of falciparum malaria in the Dominican Republic. In this highly mobile world, modern public health measures such as surveillance, early case detection, vaccination, and information dissemination have replaced traditional quarantine practices to address the challenges posed by global tourism.","International tourism has significantly impacted global public health in terms of infectious disease spread and international health regulations. The increased movement of people across borders has facilitated the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, influenza, and tuberculosis. The rapid spread of these diseases has put a strain on healthcare systems, leading to shortages in medical supplies, staffing, and capacity.

108,"What advantages do JAK inhibitors offer in COVID-19 treatment, considering their impact on cytokine signaling and immune response?","['Open access JAK inhibitors and COVID-19\nDuring SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response can be inhibited or delayed, and the subsequent persistent viral replication can induce emergency signals that may culminate in a cytokine storm contributing to the severe evolution of COVID-19. Cytokines are key regulators of the immune response and virus clearance, and, as such, are linked to the-possibly altered-response to the SARS-CoV-2. They act via a family of more than 40 transmembrane receptors that are coupled to one or several of the 4 Janus kinases (JAKs) coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Once activated, JAKs act on pathways for either survival, proliferation, differentiation, immune regulation or, in the case of type I interferons, antiviral and antiproliferative effects. Studies of graft-versus-host and systemic rheumatic diseases indicated that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) exert immunosuppressive effects that are non-redundant with those of corticotherapy. Therefore, they hold the potential to cut-off pathological reactions in COVID-19. Significant clinical experience already exists with several JAKi in COVID-19, such as baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and nezulcitinib, which were suggested by a meta-analysis (Patoulias et al.) to exert a benefit in terms of risk reduction concerning major outcomes when added to standard of care in patients with COVID-19. Yet, only baricitinib is recommended in first line for severe COVID-19 treatment by the WHO, as it is the only JAKi that has proven efficient to reduce mortality in individual randomized clinical trials (RCT), especially the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) and COV-BARRIER phase 3 trials. As for secondary effects of JAKi treatment, the main caution with baricitinib consists in the induced immunosuppression as long-term side effects should not be an issue in patients treated for COVID-19. We discuss whether a class effect of JAKi may be emerging in COVID-19 treatment, although at the moment the convincing data are for baricitinib only. Given the key role of JAK1 in both type I IFN action and signaling by cytokines involved in pathogenic effects, establishing the precise timing of treatment will be very important in future trials, along with the control of viral replication by associating antiviral molecules.Cytokine receptors and the Janus kinase-signal transducers and Activators of transcription pathway Cytokines are alpha-helical proteins of [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] aminoacids that are secreted and act on target cells as a function of expression and exposure on their surface of specific receptors. They are fundamentally required for blood formation and regulation of the immune response. In blood formation, on commitment to differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), lineage specific cytokines regulate the survival, proliferation and differentiation of progenitors and the final blood levels. 1 Cytokines act via specific cytokine receptors. The human genome codes for over 40 cytokine receptors. They all signal via Janus kinases (JAKs), initially called Just Another Kinases, that are appended non-covalently to their cytosolic tails. Four JAKs are coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Activated receptors induce via JAKs the activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). There are 7 STATs coded by the human genome. Several receptors use the same JAKs and sharing of JAKs allows specific signals by the different receptors and cytokines, but different outputs. 1 The cytokine receptor superfamily is divided in type 1 and type 2 families (figure 1) and this distinction is derived from different sequence features, such as conserved WSXWS motifs in the extracellular domains and boxes 1 and 2 motifs in the cytosolic domains for type 1 (figure 2A). 1 The type 1 family consists of homodimeric receptors (for Epo, Tpo, GCSF, Growth Hormone, Prolactin), heterodimeric receptors (for IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF), using JAK2, hetero-oligomeric receptors, using JAK1 and to some extent JAK2 and TYK2 (represented by the IL6 family receptors), 2 and finally the gamma chain using receptors (namely those for IL']",JAK inhibitors offer the advantage of cutting off pathological reactions in COVID-19 by inhibiting cytokine signaling and modulating the immune response.,"JAK inhibitors (JAKi) hold potential advantages in COVID-19 treatment due to their ability to modulate cytokine signaling and the immune response. By inhibiting Janus kinases (JAKs) that are involved in pathways regulating survival, proliferation, and immune responses, JAK inhibitors can potentially help to suppress pathological reactions, including cytokine storms, in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, JAK inhibitors like baricitinib have shown promising results in reducing mortality in severe COVID-19 cases by regulating cytokine signaling and immune responses. However, the precise timing of treatment with JAK inhibitors is crucial, as they may need to be administered during the development of cytokine storms but not too early to allow for proper viral clearance by the immune system. Further research and well-controlled clinical trials are needed to fully understand the benefits of JAK inhibitors in COVID-19 treatment.","What advantages do JAK inhibitors offer in COVID-19 treatment, considering their impact on cytokine signaling and immune response? ->: JAK inhibitors (JAKi) hold potential advantages in COVID-19 treatment due to their ability to modulate cytokine signaling and the immune response.

126,How does parental participation in a weight management program affect the relationship between skin carotenoids and meals prepared away from home in the study?,"[' if relationships between skin carotenoids and increases in consumption of fruits and vegetables as part of the parental WMP were not identified.Higher skin carotenoids were associated with lower frequency of consumption of meals prepared away from home, with significant inverse relationships identified for parents and children for fast food consumption and for children with restaurant or carry out meals at WMP initiation. These results suggest meals purchased outside the home are lower in fruits and vegetables than those prepared within the home. Previous literature also demonstrated this relationship, with away from home meals associated with poorer diet quality and lower fruit and vegetable intakes among dyads [45] . The lack of a significant relationship between skin carotenoids and meals away from home at 3-and 6-months, may indicate improvements in dietary behaviors as a result of strategies learned through parental participation in WMP.Though this study has many strengths, including longitudinal data collection, a wellestablished adult WMP, enrollment of parent-child dyads, and objective indicators of fruit and vegetable consumption and height/weight, it is not without limitations. As a single-arm study, the lack of a control group limits the ability to determine the causal effect of the WMP on outcomes. Further, the small sample size, attrition, and homogeneity of participants as well as the use of a convenience sample may limit generalizability to other populations participating in adult weight management settings. The way that fruit and vegetable consumption was measured included combined increases in ""fruit and vegetable"" intake, and did not include the preparation of these foods (i.e., raw, processed, etc.). Bioavailability of carotenoids varies based upon the food matrix, processing conditions, preparation, and several other factors, lack of information on these details in this study impedes the ability to fully elucidate mechanisms that may have impacted changes in skin carotenoids over the course of the WMP, and thus results should be interpreted with caution [46] . Finally, future work would benefit from including assessments of 24-h food recalls or food frequency questionnaires to confer with parental and child skin carotenoids.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/ 10.3390/nu13072227/s1, Table S1 : Correlation Matrix between Child and Parent Weight Status and Skin Carotenoids at Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months.

22,How does the predictive power of the DCA model compare to other measures in predicting the mutability of SARS-CoV-2?,"[""2 variants are significantly better according to the model than randomly mutated sequences, i.e. the naturally occurring mutations are, according to the model, significantly more neutral than the predominantly deleterious random mutations, as is to be expected by evolution under purifying selection. This finding indicates the capacity of DCA trained on diverged homologs to capture local constraints acting on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.The combination of these two observations is key for our work: the epistatic model is able to capture mutational effects, and the SARS-CoV-2 variants, which emerged over the last months, are significantly more neutral than random mutations. Can we use this to predict possible new variants of SARS-CoV-2 by identifying positions with favorable mutability scores? To test this idea, we compare the currently observable SARS-CoV-2 variability with the one predicted using the modelbased mutability score, and with the mutations expectable by the experimental protein expression. As mentioned before and illustrated in Fig. 1 , we operationally assess the observable variability by the number of distinct GISAID sequences having a variant amino acid (compared to the reference Wuhan-Hu-1) in the specific position under study. We observe that the DCA model and expression are similarly correlated with variability (Spearman's ρ=0.61 and 0.6, respectively), while the correlation is weaker for the IND model (ρ=0.34). This trend can also be observed in Fig. 2C by looking at the distribution of mutational scores after grouping positions by their observed variability, they grow accordingly with the variability (note that the scores are not comparable between methods, but p-values indicate a higher significance for DCA and expression than for IND).We analyze in detail the performance of these different measures as a predictor of SARS-CoV-2 mutability through Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC curves) and the resulting areas under curve (AUC), which range from 0.5 for random to 1.0 for perfect predictions. We perform the ROC analysis using a variability cutoff of 12, because it splits the set of positions into two balanced subsets of positions with low (≤12, n=93) or high (>12, n=85) variability. The DCA model and protein expression (AUC 0.76 and 0.77) show a remarkable performance in distinguishing positions with low or high variability, clearly outperforming the IND model (AUC 0.63). This result is not dependent on the particular cutoff chosen, as a similar trend is observed for a large range of variability cutoffs (Fig. S2B) . The protein expression and the DCA model perform similarly (see Fig.  S2B , averaged ROC AUC of 0.83 and 0.81, respectively), followed by the IND model (0.66). The experiment-based predictor performs comparatively better at high variability while the sequencebased ones are better at low variability (Fig. S2B) , which is probably related to the fact that highly conserved positions are usually very relevant to the function of the protein (34) . In conclusion, we observe that the different measures have a substantial predictive power of the mutability, although the IND model is worse compared to the others. The performance of the DCA models is surprisingly competitive, with a similar performance as the experimental measurements, with an advantage for lower mutabilities and a slight disadvantage for higher mutabilities, cf. Fig. 2B .The performance measured in the previous analysis is not only dependent on the intrinsic predictive power of each method but how well the ground truth is defined, in this case the variability estimated from GISAID data. Although only a fraction of all possible variants emerged in the short time since SARS-CoV-2 appeared, the observed variability has greatly evolved over time due to the great effort of sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Fig. S2A) . As an example, the number of RBD positions without observed variants has shrunk from 58 out of 178 in July 2020, to only 3 in May 2021. Interestingly, we observe a great increase in predictive performance when evaluated against more recent and richer variant libraries considered in the estimation of variability. As shown in Fig.  2E , the performance has increased from an AUC of only 0.52 considering sequences collected until July 2020 up to 0.76 with sequences until May 2021 (at each timepoint, the median variability is used to partition data into low vs. high variability, cf. Fig. S2B and Materials and Methods for details). This improvement is not only evident from the ROC analysis, but also by looking at the correlation between the DCA model and the variability with Spearman correlations of ρ=0.13, 0.35 and 0.61 in July 2020, December 2020 and May 2021, respectively, cf. Fig. S4 . This result indicates that the remarkable increase of SARS""]",The DCA model has a similar performance as the experimental measurements and outperforms the IND model in predicting the mutability of SARS-CoV-2.,"The DCA model shows competitive performance in predicting the mutability of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other measures.

As of 13 th April 2020, COVID-19 has affected 213 countries worldwide [3] . In general, COVID-19 is an acute illness but it can be deadly, with an average case fatality of 2% [4] . COVID-19 causes severe respiratory illness associated with an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and high mortality [5] . The presenting symptoms of COVID-19 include: fever, chills, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath [1, 4, 5] . There is recent anecdotal evidence that anosmia with resultant dysgeusia are frequently reported symptoms with COVID-19.In this global critical care crisis and unparalleled health emergency, nurses are the largest healthcare professional group providing frontline care. Nurses\' pivotal role in the care and management of the novel COVID-19 comes in the year landmarked as the International Year of the Nurse [6] . This global crisis is uncharted territory and the first of its kind for most nurses\' living memory bringing along new challenges already recognised by international nursing boards [7] [8] [9] [10] . At the time of writing this critical reflection, global incidence passes 1, 699 595 with more than 106, 138 fatalities see Figure 1 .Early COVID-19 outcome data has suggested a fatality rate of 5.6% among those affected by cancer [11] . A further study identified that people affected by cancer had a 3.5 times higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease than other patient groups [12] . Around the world vulnerable groups at risk of COVID-19 are people with specific cancers including those: undergoing active chemotherapy and radical radiotherapy for lung cancer; blood or bone marrow cancers such as, leukaemia or multiple myeloma (at any stage of disease); those receiving immunotherapy; antibody treatments for cancer; targeted cancer treatments that can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors;individuals who have received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in the last 6 months; or those taking immunosuppression drugs [13] . People affected by cancer could be at elevated risk of severe COVID-19 disease and may experience disrupted and delayed delivery of cancer therapies because of social distancing measures, quarantines, and general disruption in routine cancer service during this pandemic.Therefore, this article aims to provide a critical reflection of COVID-19 in the context of caring for people affected by cancer. Given that new, emerging evidence will rapidly develop over time in this clinical context, the authors would recommend nurses and clinicians to access official websites for regular updates as they emerge over the course of this pandemic, such as those provided in Table 1 .In the Preface to their book, Nurses on the Front Line: When Disaster Strikes, Wall and Keeling note:""What nurses did in the past can inform disaster preparations for today … providing historical evidence to inform disaster policies for the future"" [14, p xi] . As co-editors and contributors, Wall and Keeling asked authors to analyse nurses\' roles as components of community responses to disasters that occurred in regions in the United States, Canada, Turkey and Haiti -communicable diseases, earthquakes, hurricanes, accidents, and intentional and unintentional human errors.""Nurses"", they contend, are in positions ""to participate in all aspects of the disaster response, including evacuation, triage, physical and psychological care at the scene and afterward, case finding, screening measures, vaccinations, and disease surveillance"" [14, p xii] .The 1918 Influenza epidemic in the United States.

93,What is the focus of the proposed SciBERT-based summarization model for COVID-19 papers and how does it address the limitations of existing methods?,"[""COVIDSum: A linguistically enriched SciBERT-based summarization model for COVID-19 scientific papers\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is having a devastating impact as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) continues to spread in communities around the world. Researchers from diverse fields are accelating their research to help diagnostics, therapies and vaccines. Researchers also publish their recent research progress through scientific papers, since scientific publications enable results and ideas to be transmitted throughout the scientific community. However, manually generating the abstract of a scientific paper is time-consuming, increasing writing burden of the researchers and slowing down writing speed and publication time of the paper. Abstractive summarization technique which automatically provides researchers a reliable draft abstract, can alleviate this problem, providing a reliable draft abstract based on the paper contents before authors write the final abstract.Recently, with the rapid development of deep learning techniques, neural abstractive summarization approaches have been proposed in NLP field and they achieved significant improvement [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, directly applying existing neural abstractive summarization methods to scientific papers has major limitations. First, traditional neural abstractive summarization methods are trained and tested mainly on general domain datasets, such as CNN/Daily Mail [6] , Gigaword Corpus [7] , New York Times [8] , and thus it is difficult or even impossible to estimate their performance on scientific papers containing compact and inexplicit discourse style. Second, the lengths of scientific papers are usually much longer than other genres (e.g. news articles, blog posts, tweets). Thus, existing neural abstractive summarization methods cannot be directly applied for scientific papers. In response, we propose a novel linguistically enriched SciBERT-based model to solve the summarization task for COVID-19 scientific papers. First, we extract salient sentences from source papers using heuristic strategies, and construct word co-occurrence graphs based on the selected sentences to capture linguistic features of these sentences. Then, we apply SciBERT [9] and a graph attention network (GAT) [10] based graph encoder to encode the sentences and word co-occurrence graphs, respectively. Finally, we fuse the above two encodings using highway networks [11] , incorporating linguistic knowledge into the contextual embeddings of scientific papers, and generating an abstractive summary for each scientific paper. The main contributions of this paper are thus threefold:(1) Heuristic sentence extraction methods based on prior knowledge are developed, and word co-occurrence graphs are utilized as linguistic features of sentences. (2) A novel linguistically enhanced SciBERT-based summarization model is proposed, which utilizes pre-trained language model, graph neural networks and highway networks to incorporate linguistic knowledge into the contextual embeddings of scientific papers. (3) Thorough experimental studies are designed and conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.We organize the remaining part of this paper as follows. Section 2 reviews related works. Section 3 introduces our proposed linguistically enriched SciBERT-based summarization model. Section 4 and Section 5 present the experimental settings and the evaluation results, respectively. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.There are two major categories of approaches for scientific paper summarization: abstract generation-based approaches and citationbased approaches [12] . Abstract generation-based approaches aim to automatically generate an abstract of a research paper [13, 14] . Citationbased approaches involves generation of summaries based on a set of citing sentences in other scientific papers pointing to that paper [15] [16] [17] [18] . We focus on abstractive generation-based approaches in this study.Previous research on abstract generation for scientific articles has focused almost exclusively on extractive methods, which aim to select sentences from the original text to construct a summary of the scientific paper. Contractor et al. [14] proposed to use Argumentative Zones for extractive summarization of scientific articles. Kinugawa and Tsuruoka [19] presented a hierarchical encoder-decoder extractive summarizer for academic papers. Collins et al. [15] released a benchmark dataset for summarization of computer science publications named CSPubSum, developed a supervised extractive summarization approach, and proposed a new metric named AbstractROUGE. Yang et al. [20] leveraged data-weighted reconstruction to amplify a scientific paper's abstract. They conducted experiments on the real dataset (AAN 2 and Microsoft datasets 3 ) to confirm the effectiveness of their approach. With the release of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD- 19) 4 , researchers began to study automatic text summarization of COVID-19 medical research papers [21] [22] [23] [24] .

184,"What is the impact of parental obesity on childhood obesity and future comorbidities, and how does parental participation in adult medical weight management programs (WMPs) relate to children's dietary behaviors?","[""Changes in Parent and Child Skin Carotenoids, Weight, and Dietary Behaviors over Parental Weight Management\nAdult obesity rates have increased over the past three decades [1, 2] , with half of all United States (US) adults pursuing some form of weight loss, often through medical weight management programs (WMPs) [3, 4] . Given that parental obesity is the strongest risk factor for childhood obesity, these children are three-times more likely to develop obesity and future comorbidities extending into adulthood, as well as a shortened life expectancy [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Yet, we know very little about how parental participation in adult medical WMPs affects children's dietary behaviors [13] . Despite convincing evidence that parental participation in children's medical WMPs has positive effects on both child and parent behaviors and weight [14] [15] [16] [17] , there is a paucity of data on whether these same trends emerge when parents are the identified patient in these programs, and the child is not the focus. This is an important limitation with significant implications given that 50% of US adults are attempting weight loss many with children living with them who are at risk of obesity. Thus, understanding the influence of parental participation in medical WMPs on children's dietary behaviors is essential information needed before targeted interventions can be designed to reach a subgroup of parent-child dyads for which there are currently no tested interventions, and for children at high risk of having obesity.Prior research conducted with children of parents in adult medical WMPs is predominately cross-sectional [13, [18] [19] [20] [21] , retrospective [22, 23] , and isolated to parent-only perspectives [13, 18, 20] . Prospective assessments of dyads' objectively measured dietary behaviors are needed to determine short-and long-term effects of parental participation on children. Given that fruit and vegetable intake is part of a healthy diet and is a target in WMPs, finding accurate and feasible ways to track fruit and vegetable intake over WMP is necessary. However, obtaining parent and child objective measures of diet is time-and resource-intensive. One innovative, non-invasive way is through validated resonance Raman spectroscopy to measure carotenoid status in skin as a biomarker of fruit/vegetable intake [24, 25] . Carotenoids are phytochemicals present in many fruits and vegetables that are distributed in human tissues after consumption. Assessment of carotenoid status has been validated for use as an indicator of dietary intake [26] . Objective measures of skin carotenoids consistently demonstrate moderate to strong correlations with total serum or plasma carotenoids, and are positively associated with intake of fruits and vegetables as assessed by food frequency questionnaires and automated multiple-pass 24-h daily recalls among children ≥5 years-old [26] [27] [28] [29] . This method accounts for greater accuracy in reporting, especially from children, who often provide subjective reports for dietary intake [26] [27] [28] [29] .The objective of the study was to determine changes in parent and child fruit and vegetable intake via skin carotenoids and changes in weight (BMI, BMIz) over parental participation in an adult outpatient medical WMP, and associations between parent and child carotenoids and changes in weight, reported fruit and vegetable intake, and family meal frequency and patterns. It was hypothesized that: (1) parents experience significant decreases in BMI and increases in skin carotenoids; (2) parent and child skin carotenoids are correlated at each visit; (3) higher skin carotenoids in parents and children are associated with lower parent BMI and child BMIz at each visit; (4) higher parent and child skin carotenoids are associated with parent and child reports of increased fruit and vegetable intake at each visit; (5) more frequent family meals are associated with higher parent and child skin carotenoids at each visit; and (6) more frequent fast food, delivery, and restaurant/carry out consumption are associated with lower parent and child skin carotenoids at each visit.The study was a part of a larger study about the effects on children from parental participation in an adult medical WMP. The single group, longitudinal design utilized objective and survey assessments from WMP initiation, 3-months (mid-program), and 6-months (program end). Recruitment took place at parents' WMP orientation from November 2018 to March 2020, in which every eligible parent-child dyad was invited to participate.

127,Which proteins make up viral particles and how abundant are they in gradient-purified viral preparations?,"[' HN protein fraction in the antigen preparation used for immunization of mice, we were able to obtain six hybridoma cultures that are reactive by HI, i.e. are able to block the receptor binding site of the HN protein on erythrocytes, and four of them neutralized viral infectivity in LMH cell cultures. In addition, three further selected hybridoma cultures neither showed HI nor neutralizing activity. By western blot analyses, these latter MAbs revealed reactivity against viral proteins that migrate at 55 kD and, hence, do not target HN. In the past, antibodies against NDV have been prepared by using whole, mostly gradient-purified virus preparations [24, 26, 47] . With this approach Lana and colleagues reported that five hybridoma fusion experiments yielded 20 NDV specific MAbs, of which only three were reactive by HI. Earlier reports [35] obtained a single MAb from a total of 184 maintained hybridoma cultures that was specifically reactive with the homologous virus by HI. The described problems to obtain sufficient numbers of MAbs reactive with ND spike proteins might in part be explained by the composition of the viral particle, which is dominated by the highly immunogenic NP protein that fills the entire inner virion [48] . In addition, the M protein, forming an array underneath the viral membrane is abundant in the virion [49] . Both proteins account for ~ 30% of the virus-specific molecular masses in gradient-purified viral preparations when analyzed by nano-LC MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, and only about 10% of the virion are HN molecules [11; Karger personal communication]. By disrupting gradient-purified virus by Triton X-100 (2%) and 1 M KCl, Nishikawa and colleagues could increase the fraction of HI reactive HN-specific MAbs, retrieving 9 out of a total of 21 [50] . Our method also used Triton X-100 and KCl disruption, but we subsequently applied ultracentrifugation to enrich HN and deplete M and NP proteins. This procedure was able to pull down a high proportion of the proteins that migrate as a 55 kD band including the NP. The subsequent steps reduced the proportion of the 55 kD proteins further, but were not sufficient to remove all of the proteins: A slight band was still visible by Coomassie-staining (Fig. 1a) and reacted with the polyclonal antibody preparation from a ND vaccinated chicken (Fig. 1b) . This might be a result of incomplete separation of the interaction of the HN protein with the NP protein via the matrix protein [51] . Accordingly, three of the selected MAbs were reactive with the 55 kD band by western blot (Fig. 3) . However, the western blot with an F-specific (Fig. 1d) identified that a large proportion of the F1 protein was in the very first pellet of the antigen preparation, indicating that F protein was not part of the antigen. This would be in line with results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments, showing a direct interaction of F and NP and HN and M [51] . Thus, it is likely that the three HI-negative MAbs are directed against NP or P protein. Further studies on protein specificity will have to address this question and evaluate potential potency in diagnostic approaches. Harsher conditions for particle disruption might have yielded an improved depletion of nucleocapsid proteins but, at the same time, may have denatured HN and destroyed HI epitope conformation.Overall our aim to produce MAbs capable to block biologically active sites of the HN protein of genotype 2.VII NDV by using an HN-enriched fraction of purified virus proved to be successful. We obtained a sufficient number of HI-positive MAbs already with a single fusion experiment, and two thirds of the selected hybridoma cultures yielded HN-specific MAbs that were able to block receptor binding.Due to the complex structure of biologically relevant epitopes of the homo-tetrameric HN protein [52] [53] [54] , the approach to generate MAbs reactive with biologically activesites depends on native HN protein with the correct conformation, ideally from virus produced in eukaryotic cells ensuring bona fide glycosylation and folding. Reassuring evidence was obtained through the HI-positive antibody response of two mice immunized with enriched HN preparations. However, in order to select the appropriate antibodies, the screening system has to present the test antigen in its native conformation. When using the indirect ELISA techniques, immobilizing antigen directly to the plastic surfaces of the plates likely interferes with the conformational integrity of the antigen, and important epitopes may be unpredictably masked or exposed [55] . To avoid such structural alterations caused by the coating, Russel and colleagues used NDV infected and formalin fixed cells with']",The NP protein and the M protein make up viral particles.

51,What are some architectures used for object detection in computer vision?,"["" two main optimization criteria are the accuracy of the prediction and the time inferred to obtain the solution ever more tailored solutions building on CNNs are being developed recently. Architectures such as VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) and ResNet (He et al. 2015a) for image classification and Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) and SSD (Liu et al. 2016 ) for object detection have proven to provide good accuracy at resonable inference time.CV is utilized for infrastructure inspection in many application domains. The typical challenges addressed with CV in this area are cases where large amounts of physical objects are to be inspected and they are geographically remote and / or dispersed. Selected research articles are presented in the following and summarized in Table 1. A major application area is road surface inspection and maintenance. Roads in bad condition can ultimately result in more accidents and higher costs (Baladi et al. 2017; Gleave et al. 2014) . Thus, CV is utilized to automatically assess road surface condition and derive necessary maintenance actions. Over the last years this became possible without expensive, specialized hardware (compare, e.g., Quintana et al. 2016) . Chatterjee et al. (2018) show how machine learning-based CV can be used to detect road surface cracks and develop a ''vision-based DSS for crack detection''. They offer first insights into a nascent design theory for the application case of road crack detection on the basis of images.Not only roads, but also railways need to be inspected periodically to ensure safe transports. Wei et al. (2019) employ a Faster R-CNN to detect defects of railway track fasteners. Gibert et al. (2017) propose a CNN-based multitask learning approach that detects railway track fasteners and crossties and classifies the state of these components.Wind turbine blades are another physical object of interest for CV-based infrastructure inspection. Akhloufi and Benmesbah (2014) present a CV approach to identify ice accreation on wind turbine blades. Ice accreation can require a maintenance action since it can cause malfunction and premature wear and is a safety hazard for nearby people and infrastructure like roads and powerlines. Shihavuddin et al. (2019) show how faults like leading edge erosion can be detected with a Faster R-CNN on wind turbine blades.In this work, we are particularly interested in CV solutions for power line inspection relying on UAV images. From a component-based view, power line inspection can be divided into four major categories: towers or poles, insulators, conductors, and fittings (Liu et al. 2020) . Each of these categories contains several subcomponents (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) that typically vary in size, kind, and material according to the voltage level. For instance, some part of a distribution network with low voltage might have wooden poles, small standing insulators, and a single, relatively thin conductor. On the other hand, transmission networks usually have lattice steel towers, large suspending insulators, and thicker conductors. Several studies have been published that utilize various potential platforms (e.g., helicopter, satellite, and UAV) to collect different data types (e.g., optical images, laser scanner data, thermal images, and synthetic aperture radar images) and analyzed these (Matikainen et al. 2016) . The vision-based approach -with image data from the visible spectrum captured by UAVs and automatically analyzed through image processing capabilities -has gained the most attention and traction in the power line inspection research domain (Liu et al. 2020) . With a few exceptions, automated vision-based power line inspection based on UAV-captured images requires two inherently related tasks (Liu et al. 2020) : component detection and localization as well as fault diagnosis. The exceptions relate to objects such as bird nests, whose detection already represents a fault. Previous research applying image processing for the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs is numerous (Mirallès et al. 2014) . Liu et al. (2020) identify several characteristics and shortcomings of previous studies using UAV-captured images in their exhaustive literature review. Most studies in the field of vision-based inspection of power lines focus on the insulator and its faults (Liu et al. 2020 ) -mainly missing caps (e.g., Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019; Zhai et al. 2018 ) -while little attention has been paid to other components. The safety pin that prevents other components from loosening and falling is the smallest object in the power line and has, despite its importance, received little attention and has only been regarded in fault diagnosis but not in the detection step. Finally, both Liu et al. (2020) and Nguyen et al. (2018) conclude that the mediocre performance of task-specific approaches presented in the vast majority of studies has been superseded by DL approaches that have improved""]","Architectures such as VGG16, ResNet, Faster R-CNN, and SSD have been used for object detection in computer vision.",Some well-proven architectures used for object detection in computer vision include SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) and Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks).

112,What are the psychological distress and COVID-19 concerns for HD and PD patients on dialysis?,"[' (Table 5) . We compared precautionary measures taken for COVID-19 between HD and PD patients. Results are shown in Table 4 . Table 5 shows results of correlation between psychological distress and precautionary measures in the whole cohort. We also analyzed each group separately. Results are shown in Table 6 . There was no significant difference in precautionary measures except for the compliance of wearing masks between HD and PD patients. PD patients had better compliance of wearing masks regardless of symptoms than HD patients in the matched cohort, showing a less significant (p = 0.018) difference between the two. PD patients answered either ""very likely"" (68.6%) or ""somewhat likely""(31.4%) to the question about wearing masks. In contrast, 6.4% (n = 5) of HD patients answered ""not very likely."" Symptoms of stress and insomnia were associated with wearing masks in the whole cohort (Table 5 ). More PD patients tended to self report adherence to cough etiquette and hand hygiene than HD patients, although the difference between the two was not statistically significant. Of PD patients, 45.7% answered ""very likely"" to the question about whether they covered their mouths when coughing and sneezing, whereas only 29.5% of HD patients did so (p = 0.757). Regarding hand hygiene, 26.9% of PD patients and 13.5% of HD patients answered ""very likely"" about washing hands (p = 0.166). There was no significant difference patients in the habit of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks) during meals between HD and PD patients. The average time staying at In this study, we investigated COVID-19-related psychological stress experienced by dialysis patients and the difference in concerns between HD and PD patients. First, dialysis patients had relatively high psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Second, HD patients showed higher psychological distress and concerns related to COVID-19 than PD patients. Third, various concerns and precautionary measures for COVID-19 were associated with the psychological distress of HD and PD patients. In a previous study that meta-analyzed factors associated with psychological distress, pre-existing physical conditions with higher COVID-19 infection risk were associated with higher anxiety and depression [22] , consistent with results of the present study showing a high degree of anxiety and depression symptoms and psychological distress in dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Sources of distress might include feelings of vulnerability or the loss of control and concerns about one\'s health and the spread of the virus [23] . The fact that COVID-19 is transmitted humanto-human and that it is associated with high morbidity might intensify the perception of personal health problems, especially for patients with chronic illnesses [24, 25] . However, due to the sudden occurrence of this outbreak, we were unable to assess an individual\'s psychological condition before the outbreak. Since there were no data before COVID-19, it was difficult to conclude that the more pronounced psychological distress of HD patients was only due to COVID-19. Interestingly, a recent study in the Netherlands [26] investigating the mental health of dialysis patients (on HD, PD, and home hemodialysis [HHD]) during COVID-19 and compared with the period preceding the pandemic has reported the mental health of dialysis patients is unaffected by the pandemic. To overcome this limitation, we included concerns and precautionary measures taken for COVID-19 and showed their associations with the psychological distress of patients. We also tried to identify the difference between HD and PD patients. They decided their dialysis modalities with balanced information. As a result, they have a unique medical behavior. Thus, it is worth to investigate how dialysis modalities work in the COVID-19 era. According to our study, the psychological distress of COVID-19 was more pronounced in HD patients than in PD patients. Interestingly, in our regression analysis, HD patients had lower level of confidence. This can be related to the severity of their depressive and anxiety symptoms. The nature of patients undergoing HD being highly dependent on the hospitals and doctors might have an impact on the above results. Regarding concerns about COVID-19, more than half of both HD and PD patients felt there was too much unnecessary worry about COVID-19. Chronic disease patients experienced psychological distress more than the general population in previous studies [22, 27] , similar to our results. In addition, compared to PD patients, more HD patients responded that they felt less likely to be exposed to the virus. However, only a few of them answered that they would survive if infected with COVID-19. These results suggest that HD patients might have cognitive bias related to risk perception and more emotional impact than PD patients. Cognitive biases are associated with psychopathology. They may alter threat perception, while risk perception is strongly associated with the emotional impact of the threat itself [28] . In terms of precautionary measures, PD patients maintained cough etiquette better with']",The novel '1984' by George Orwell is set in a dystopian future where the world is divided into three superstates.,"In this study, it was found that dialysis patients, including both HD and PD patients, experienced relatively high psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

148,Why is responsible reporting on Veterans and their issues important for Canadian journalists and what areas need improvement in their coverage?,"["" study period spanned only 12 months, which can only give a snapshot of current portrayals, but can not give long-term information about time-trends. As such, longitudinal research is necessary to assess change over time. Third, the study only collected data from a single jurisdiction (Canada), and while comparisons have been made with studies from other jurisdictions, these other studies employed different methodologies and occurred during different time frames. Purpose-built between-country comparative studies would provide a better foundation for the comparison of media coverage between different jurisdictions. Fourth, data collection occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have had an influence on reporting patterns, meaning that the July 2020-July 2021 time period is not a 'typical' year. Fifth, we did not engage in correlational analysis between some of the key variables, nor make any comparisons in coverage between types of media (e.g. English-language versus French-language, page one stories versus inside pages stories etc.), as this was beyond the scope of the present study, and such an approach would be hampered by small cell sizes and low number of cases among relevant variables. The article is purposely descriptive to give an overview of general patterns and adherence to guidelines, which is consistent with the pointed aims of the study and addresses a gap in the literature on Veteran portrayals in the Canadian media. These limitations could be addressed in future purpose-driven research with larger samples conducted over a multi-year period.To conclude, the present study reveals that the Canadian news media frequently focus on issues of honour and commemoration when reporting Veterans. Compared to the US media, there are far fewer articles on Veterans as victims or drug/alcohol issues in Veterans. Moreover, articles about suicide and PTSD tend to adhere to Mindset guidelines, though there remains room for improvement when reporting these issues. However, there are also very few articles about Afghanistan Veterans, female Veterans, and Veterans who served outside the Canadian army.In sum, the results suggest a need for more educational outreach to help Canadian journalists responsibly report Veterans and their issues, with a focus on (i) diversifying coverage to represent the full heterogeneity of Veterans and Veteran experience; (ii) improved adherence to Mindset guidelines when reporting suicide and PTSD in Veterans; (iii) including more stories focusing on mastery of crises, resilience in the face of adversity and messages of hope and recovery in relation to PTSD and suicide; and (iv) reporting Veterans and their experiences outside of newsworthy clusters and anomalous events, especially focusing on successful reintegration and life progress. Such efforts may help shape a wider social climate of respect, inclusion and support for all Canadian Veterans that may lead to less stigma and stereotypes.

95,"How can a single genome predict mutability in a new viral pathogen, considering host-specific interactions and available sequence data?","["" has its limitations, most importantly their dependence on the availability of sufficiently large and diverged sequence ensembles. In fact, we observe that a greater number of sequences usually increases the performance of the approach (Fig. 4C and S10). However, it is important to note that the inclusion of more divergent sequences might not always be the best strategy as the model might capture constraints that are not relevant for the specific SARS-CoV-2 context. This trade-off will be explored in future work.Our approach can be extended in several ways. One is to include how different domains might constrain the variability of other domains. However, according to our analysis in the previous section, inter-domain epistasis seems to play only a minor role, even if more sequence data might be needed to better estimate the influence of inter-domain or inter-protein epistasis. Another is to model constraints due to specific virus-host interaction, which is currently out of our scope, as we do not consider host sequences in the MSAs. Indeed, we observe the correlation of experimental binding to ACE2 and our predictions (Pearson's r = 0.27) can be fully explained through the protein expression (Pearson's r partial correlation controlled by expression = -0.02). In an attempt to explore this issue, we built co-alignments of receptor-binding domains with homologs of ACE2 present in the hosts of other coronaviruses. Since the binding mechanism between RBD and ACE2 homologs is present only in sarbecoviruses, the resulting co-alignment of RBD and ACE2 homologs contains only 7 effective sequences (non-redundant sequences at 80% identity, cf. Materials and Methods), a number being insufficient to capture the complex virus-host interactions.Predicting evolution is an undoubtedly daunting task (43, 44) . While there is little, if any, hope to predict specific future evolutionary events, we have shown that data-driven approaches capturing statistical patterns in sequence data can effectively identify more general evolutionary trends, such as which positions are more likely to mutate and represent a concern to current therapeutic interventions. In this sense, our work is a step forward to a more precise characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution fuelled by a huge worldwide effort of research and monitoring of the virus, whose evolution is unfolding in almost real time at an unprecedented level of detail.While the main application of our work is the insights provided on SARS-CoV-2, our study can also be seen as a proof of concept. In the case of emergence of a new viral pathogen, a single sequenced genome can be used as the reference to first extract families of homologous sequences from public databases, which allow for learning the statistical models needed for mutability predictions. These predictions can therefore be done in very early stages of a possible outbreak, before large amounts of observational or experimental data become available, forecast future variability and thereby help to direct our attention to not yet observed mutations.Sequence data in FASTA format were downloaded from the following databases: GISAID ( (7) A global database including distant species was built by combining Uniref90, ViPR, NCBI viral genomes and MERS coronavirus database, and used to train the DCA and IND models. We built MSAs by running jackhmmer with 5 iterations and starting both with the full-length reference protein sequence (except for the ORF1ab) and with the trimmed domain sequence (SI text for more details). For each domain, we selected the MSA with more non-redundant sequences between the two resulting MSAs for further analysis, which increases the amount of available sequence data. As quality controls, all sequences including non-standard amino acids were removed as well as repeated sequences or sequences covering less than 80% of the reference; predictions are robust when modifying this threshold, cf. Fig. S11A . To separate training from test data, all sequences closer than 90% sequence identity to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference were filtered out (i.e. all SARS-CoV-2 sequences, including close relatives in non-human hosts). The exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences has a negligible influence on the predictions, e.g. the spearman's correlation on the RBD of the DCA scores with protein expression with and without the reference sequence is the same (ρ=0.54) as well as in the case of the observed variability (ρ=0.61).For the GISAID database, a MSA for each domain sequence was built with only 1 iteration in jackhmmer as the GISAID sequences are very similar to the reference sequences. We applied the same quality controls as before but keeping sequences closer than 90% sequence identity and removing sequences corresponding to a non-human host. The July and December 2020 subsets of sequences were collected until the 16th of the corresponding month. The alignments"", "". While the use of other coronaviruses enlarges substantially the datasets making data-driven modeling more robust, we may, however, partially lose information about hostspecific constraints like the interaction with host-cell receptors (e.g. ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2) or with the host's immune system.While models are learned from diverged homologs, the prediction of mutable sites requires a SARS-CoV-2 genome (in our case the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain) to be used as reference: our models assign a mutability score to each position in each SARS-CoV-2 protein. This score reflects the constraints acting on a position when mutating away from the reference strain. Other SARS-CoV-2 genomes are only required to test our predictions: we assess the predictive power of our approach and of IND models by validating the predictions with the mutations actually observed in SARS-CoV-2 proteomes deposited in GISAID (gisaid.org, (7)). We carry out a detailed study of the receptor binding domain (RBD) as it plays a pivotal role in viral attachment, fusion and entry and is the primary target for antibody therapies and vaccine development (23, 24) . For this specific domain, additional deep mutational scanning (DMS) data are available measuring how amino acid mutations of RBD affect protein expression (a proxy of protein stability) and binding to the human ACE2 receptor (25) , allowing us to investigate more deeply their relationship with the DCA mutability score, and with the observed variability across SARS-CoV-2 variants.Most observed mutations are neutral and do not affect the virus phenotype (26) , however mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic regions, i.e. targets of human B and T cells, may allow the virus to evade the immune response induced by vaccination or previous infection. By combining our DCA-mutability scores with data from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB, (27) ), we identify a restricted set of positions in the RBD that are expected to be both mutable and highly immunogenic. Interestingly, we observe that most circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOC or VOI have mutations in a subset of those positions. This combined approach also suggests novel positions that are more likely to mutate in the future and whose mutations could induce a reduction in immune response. In this sense, our predictions may help the rational design of new immunogenic or therapeutic strategies, such as monoclonal antibodies or vaccines, to become more efficient against potential future SARS-CoV-2 strains by targeting less mutable positions.Data are highly dynamic during the ongoing pandemic. A new variant, Omicron (B.1.1.529), has recently emerged and was rapidly declared VOC during the final revision of this paper. Due to the great interest in characterizing this variant, we have included a new analysis of its RBD mutations. As compared to all pre-existing variants, Omicron increases even the number of mutable and immunogenic positions.Also, beyond the case of SARS-CoV-2, our study can be seen as a proof-of-concept study. Since we need only a single reference genome to search for distant homologs and make predictions, the approach can be applied very early in any potential viral outbreak in the future. Such predictions may be particularly valuable in situations, where observational data on newly emerging pathogens are missing.According to the Pfam protein-domain family database (28) , the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (isolate Wuhan-Hu-1) contains 39 protein domains (see Table S1 ) covering 81% (7860 out of 9748 residues) of the entire proteome. For each of these domains, we predict the mutability using both the epistatic DCA and the independent IND models following the general scheme illustrated in Fig. 1 and detailed in Materials and Methods:• For each protein (domain), we extract MSA of homologous sequences from public sequence databases. These sequences, which belong almost exclusively to other coronaviridae, diverged during up to ~10 3 -10 8 years from their common ancestors with SARS-CoV-2 (29) . They are used to train IND and DCA models. These models are applied to the protein sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1 to predict the mutability of each site. Note that only a single SARS-CoV-2 sequence is needed in this step. • We validate the models using deep-mutational scanning data measuring protein expression, which are currently available only for the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.To this aim, we compare experimentally measured mutational effects with model-based predictions. • We use SARS-CoV-2""]","Since we need only a single reference genome to search for distant homologs and make predictions, the approach can be applied very early in any potential viral outbreak in the future.

245,How can healthcare professionals' behavior be influenced in COVID-19 prevention and treatment using nudging techniques?,"['Nudging healthcare professionals to improve treatment of COVID-19: a narrative review\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on healthcare systems worldwide and disrupted routine care. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) have had to quickly improvise and adapt to cope with a novel deadly virus with uncertain treatment options, lack of evidence, and a shortage of medical supply and personal protective equipment.In an ideal world, clinicians would base their decisions on scientific evidence and best practices. In practice, however, behavioural science shows that decisions are affected by emotional and cognitive biases, especially under stress. 1 2 Understanding the behavioural nature of decision-making is essential for designing processes that mitigate risks and improve the quality of care. This is particularly important because of the fast-paced developments characterising the COVID-19 pandemic.One effective strategy in improving decision-making is nudging: subtle changes to the design of the environment or framing choices without restrictions to encourage a given behaviour. 3 These strategies are often easy to scale and implement at a low cost, making nudging a practical approach to behaviour change. 4 Nudging interventions have been widely effective, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] but often patient directed, and less attention has been given to the use of behavioural insights to support HCPs in making appropriate medical decisions.In this review, we synthesise the available literature on how nudging techniques can be used to affect the behaviour of HCPs in clinical settings in order to see if these can be useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The results are intended to guide and inspire quick implementation of cost-effective solutions that can improve the quality of care.Our objective was to identify interventions using nudge theory 3 to affect the behaviour of HCPs in clinical settings, focusing on target groups, nudging techniques, delivery systems and empirical evidence.Open access intervention, including purpose, target behaviour, measured outcomes, key findings, nudging strategies used and their theoretical underpinnings. The characteristics of the nudging strategies that would allow for systematic grouping were identified. Several grouping approaches were discussed until the most appropriate grouping was selected. The studies were categorised and characterised using descriptive analysis.Nudging is often referenced to two modes of thinking: the automatic system (system 1) and the reflective system (system 2). 3 17 However, the underlying behavioural strategies that give rise to different interventions are not always described or easy to characterise. Therefore, we categorised the nudging strategies according to two practical dimensions: ► Synchronous versus asynchronous: an intervention strategy is synchronous if its delivery coincides with the decision or behaviour it intends to affect, while an asynchronous strategy can be performed anytime. For example, providing alternative options when a clinician is prescribing antibiotics in the electronic system is a synchronous strategy: alternative options (nudge) are presented when the prescription (target behaviour) is taking place. A poster providing information on sound antibiotic prescribing is an asynchronous strategy not connected to a specific prescription. ► Active versus passive: an active strategy cannot be completed without action from the targeted clinician, while a passive strategy does not require any action. For example, requesting written justifications for an antibiotic prescription to complete the order is active strategy: the prescription (target behaviour) cannot be completed without justification (nudge), while changing the default prescription is a passive strategy.The database search yielded 1436 articles (figure 1); 36 duplicates and additional 1352 articles that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria were excluded. Of the 48 articles included for full-text review, 28 were excluded because they were not relevant to COVID-19, resulting in 20 articles included in the analysis. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and five focused on encouraging judicious antibiotic prescription. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Out of the 20 studies included for analysis, seven employed more than one medium of intervention, and 13 employed only one. While seven studies delivered the intervention via electronic health records (EHRs) or electronic prescription ordering systems, nine used communication technologies such as email, text messages or traditional letters. Six studies altered the physical environment by using posters, lights or aromatisation, two made modifications to the ventilation machines and two introduced electronic dashboards. Seventeen of the 20 articles had a statistically significant positive result (online supplemental table S1). Of the three that failed, two 24 29 delivered the nudge through email and one through letter. 30 Overall, 28 different nudging strategies were identified, including accountable justifications, active choices, alerts and reminders, default settings, environmental cueing, feedback, peer comparison, goal setting, information transparency, suggested alternatives and education (online supplemental table S1). There was no standard nomenclature across articles, and many of the articles did not discuss the underlying behavioural theories that gave rise to the nudging intervention.The authors']",The available literature suggests that nudging techniques can be used to affect the behavior of healthcare professionals in clinical settings in order to improve the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.,"Healthcare professionals' behavior in COVID-19 prevention and treatment can be influenced using nudging techniques, which are subtle changes in the design of the environment or framing choices without restrictions to encourage specific behaviors. Nudging strategies can be implemented in clinical settings to support HCPs in making appropriate medical decisions. These strategies can range from active interventions that enable clinicians to consciously reflect on target behaviors to passive interventions that reduce cognitive burdens by making behaviors easier or automatic. Examples of nudging strategies include improving hand hygiene, increasing vaccination rates, avoiding unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, and optimizing care to save lives during the pandemic. Nudging interventions can be delivered via electronic health records (EHRs) or electronic prescription systems, using both passive and active strategies to influence HCP behavior effectively.","How can healthcare professionals' behavior be influenced in COVID-19 prevention and treatment using nudging techniques? ->: Healthcare professionals' behavior in COVID-19 prevention and treatment can be influenced using nudging techniques, which are subtle changes in the design of the environment or framing choices without restrictions to encourage specific behaviors.

230,"How does Canadian media coverage of Veterans compare to US media in terms of focus on honour, commemoration, victimization, drug/alcohol issues, suicide, PTSD, Afghanistan Veterans, female Veterans, Veterans outside the Canadian army, and successful reintegration?","["" study period spanned only 12 months, which can only give a snapshot of current portrayals, but can not give long-term information about time-trends. As such, longitudinal research is necessary to assess change over time. Third, the study only collected data from a single jurisdiction (Canada), and while comparisons have been made with studies from other jurisdictions, these other studies employed different methodologies and occurred during different time frames. Purpose-built between-country comparative studies would provide a better foundation for the comparison of media coverage between different jurisdictions. Fourth, data collection occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have had an influence on reporting patterns, meaning that the July 2020-July 2021 time period is not a 'typical' year. Fifth, we did not engage in correlational analysis between some of the key variables, nor make any comparisons in coverage between types of media (e.g. English-language versus French-language, page one stories versus inside pages stories etc.), as this was beyond the scope of the present study, and such an approach would be hampered by small cell sizes and low number of cases among relevant variables. The article is purposely descriptive to give an overview of general patterns and adherence to guidelines, which is consistent with the pointed aims of the study and addresses a gap in the literature on Veteran portrayals in the Canadian media. These limitations could be addressed in future purpose-driven research with larger samples conducted over a multi-year period.To conclude, the present study reveals that the Canadian news media frequently focus on issues of honour and commemoration when reporting Veterans. Compared to the US media, there are far fewer articles on Veterans as victims or drug/alcohol issues in Veterans. Moreover, articles about suicide and PTSD tend to adhere to Mindset guidelines, though there remains room for improvement when reporting these issues. However, there are also very few articles about Afghanistan Veterans, female Veterans, and Veterans who served outside the Canadian army.In sum, the results suggest a need for more educational outreach to help Canadian journalists responsibly report Veterans and their issues, with a focus on (i) diversifying coverage to represent the full heterogeneity of Veterans and Veteran experience; (ii) improved adherence to Mindset guidelines when reporting suicide and PTSD in Veterans; (iii) including more stories focusing on mastery of crises, resilience in the face of adversity and messages of hope and recovery in relation to PTSD and suicide; and (iv) reporting Veterans and their experiences outside of newsworthy clusters and anomalous events, especially focusing on successful reintegration and life progress. Such efforts may help shape a wider social climate of respect, inclusion and support for all Canadian Veterans that may lead to less stigma and stereotypes. This can facilitate Veteran integration into society, which in turn can promote their mental health and well-being, and may ultimately help prevent suicide and foster recovery from PTSD and other mental illnesses.""]","The present study reveals that Canadian news media frequently focus on issues of honour and commemoration when reporting Veterans.

41,How does interpretability enhance decision-making in fault diagnosis?,"["" image understanding (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) despite the challenging conditions of outdoor application. CNNs provide a method for automatically learning features in images, which can drastically reduce the effort in hand-designing solutions and improve generalization. In summary, this makes its application promising for the analysis of images containing PLCs (Jalil et al. 2019; Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Prates et al. 2019) . Consequently, based on the assumption that all relevant components are captured in images, they can be extracted using DL. In particular, the assessment of a component's condition features is determined by two factors. First, the component needs to be detected in the captured image, containing one or more component objects. Second, each detected component requires component-specific fault diagnosis. The system should therefore include these two tasks performed by a DL approach.DP2 -Image processing: Provide the system with state-of-the art deep learning for the detection and fault diagnosis of components.Images containing PLCs form the basis of the IB-DSS for vision-based maintenance. However, without any additional information the images can hardly be seen as sufficient for a system designed for component maintenance. To enable MEs in their decision-making, metadata (Sen 2004) regarding the images or contained components is required. The primary purpose of this metadata is to provide context (DR2) to the reported data and therefore provide enriching information that leads to knowledge creation (Nicola 2005) . It can describe both physical (e.g., towers and insulators) as well as digital objects (e.g., images and documents) through providing values or information for certain characteristics (Clobridge 2010) . The main purpose of attaching metadata to a data item is to uniquely identify it in a system and to find it by browsing or searching (Burgin 2016) . In the PLM, metadata can range from geographical and temporal image tags all the way to geographical location, age, history, et cetera of the individual infrastructure components. However, the main consideration to be taken here is that the physical objects, such as towers, insulators, or conductors, are to be considered the focal data as they represent the maintained infrastructure. The captured images contain information about these components and should therefore be appropriately linked, at best based on the individual component.DP3 -Metadata: Provide the system with metadata.The availability of context in the form of simple metadata such as the geographic location and a time stamp or advanced/processed metadata such as the object location, object type, and binary fault presence adds valuable information to an IB-DSS. However, in terms of context for the individual fault contained in an image, these details are of limited help. In the light of fault diagnosis, the required context (DR2) should be defined as parts of it that can be accessed to clarify and understand the fault. The combination of the contextualized fault diagnosis as well as visualization of the extracted information (DR5) directly results in necessary interpretability of the decision in the fault diagnosis. Consequently, the decision of the fault diagnosis should be interpretable for MEs such that they are able to comprehend why for instance an insulator was marked as faulty. Thereby, we adapt the definition of Miller (2019) [p. 14] referring to interpretability as ''the degree to which an observer can understand the cause of a decision''. The interpretability of the results of the fault diagnosis provides MEs with additional information (context) at a PLC level which in turn enhances their ability to make high-quality decisions.DP4 -Interpretability: Provide the system with interpretable fault diagnosis.To facilitate decision-making in PLM, we found that acquired and processed data should be visualized (DR5) to the respective users in order to determine a fault's existence, location, and significance. Because such a user interface can be considered as the ''source of many of the power, flexibility, and ease of use'' (Turban et al. 2010, p. 100) of a DSS, it requires careful consideration. MEs face a situation where they need to compile well-defined, complete, and prioritized maintenance orders with a variety of details and latent information requiring their consideration. An appropriate interface should therefore harness visual data exploration (Keim 2002) by integrating its user into the data exploration process by applying their perceptual abilities. It can help the personnel to answer the mission critical questions such as the required equipment and achieve high decision quality regarding maintenance prioritization.DP5 -Visual data exploration: Provide the system with an interface for visual data exploration.To improve the planning and scoping of individual maintenance orders, enhanced data and information quality needs to be provided to MEs. By following the prescribed tentative DPs for an IB-DSS our designed and evaluated artifact provides evidence of achieving this objective. The artifact is integrated into our case company by deriving specific capabilities to satisfy the DPs, termed design features (DFs) (Meth""]",The interpretability of the results of the fault diagnosis provides MEs with additional information (context) at a PLC level which in turn enhances their ability to make high-quality decisions.,"Interpretability in fault diagnosis enhances decision-making by allowing maintenance engineers to understand the cause of a decision. This means that they can comprehend why a specific component, like an insulator, was marked as faulty. By providing interpretable results, maintenance engineers gain additional context at a PLC level, enabling them to make high-quality decisions. This understanding helps them localize faults faster, develop a thorough comprehension of the fault, and accelerate root cause analysis, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective maintenance decision-making.","How does interpretability enhance decision-making in fault diagnosis? ->: Interpretability in fault diagnosis enhances decision-making by allowing maintenance engineers to understand the cause of a decision.

205,What was the aim of producing monoclonal antibodies that block biologically active sites of the HN protein of genotype 2.VII NDV using an HN-enriched fraction of purified virus?,"[' HN protein fraction in the antigen preparation used for immunization of mice, we were able to obtain six hybridoma cultures that are reactive by HI, i.e. are able to block the receptor binding site of the HN protein on erythrocytes, and four of them neutralized viral infectivity in LMH cell cultures. In addition, three further selected hybridoma cultures neither showed HI nor neutralizing activity. By western blot analyses, these latter MAbs revealed reactivity against viral proteins that migrate at 55 kD and, hence, do not target HN. In the past, antibodies against NDV have been prepared by using whole, mostly gradient-purified virus preparations [24, 26, 47] . With this approach Lana and colleagues reported that five hybridoma fusion experiments yielded 20 NDV specific MAbs, of which only three were reactive by HI. Earlier reports [35] obtained a single MAb from a total of 184 maintained hybridoma cultures that was specifically reactive with the homologous virus by HI. The described problems to obtain sufficient numbers of MAbs reactive with ND spike proteins might in part be explained by the composition of the viral particle, which is dominated by the highly immunogenic NP protein that fills the entire inner virion [48] . In addition, the M protein, forming an array underneath the viral membrane is abundant in the virion [49] . Both proteins account for ~ 30% of the virus-specific molecular masses in gradient-purified viral preparations when analyzed by nano-LC MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, and only about 10% of the virion are HN molecules [11; Karger personal communication]. By disrupting gradient-purified virus by Triton X-100 (2%) and 1 M KCl, Nishikawa and colleagues could increase the fraction of HI reactive HN-specific MAbs, retrieving 9 out of a total of 21 [50] . Our method also used Triton X-100 and KCl disruption, but we subsequently applied ultracentrifugation to enrich HN and deplete M and NP proteins. This procedure was able to pull down a high proportion of the proteins that migrate as a 55 kD band including the NP. The subsequent steps reduced the proportion of the 55 kD proteins further, but were not sufficient to remove all of the proteins: A slight band was still visible by Coomassie-staining (Fig. 1a) and reacted with the polyclonal antibody preparation from a ND vaccinated chicken (Fig. 1b) . This might be a result of incomplete separation of the interaction of the HN protein with the NP protein via the matrix protein [51] . Accordingly, three of the selected MAbs were reactive with the 55 kD band by western blot (Fig. 3) . However, the western blot with an F-specific (Fig. 1d) identified that a large proportion of the F1 protein was in the very first pellet of the antigen preparation, indicating that F protein was not part of the antigen. This would be in line with results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments, showing a direct interaction of F and NP and HN and M [51] . Thus, it is likely that the three HI-negative MAbs are directed against NP or P protein. Further studies on protein specificity will have to address this question and evaluate potential potency in diagnostic approaches. Harsher conditions for particle disruption might have yielded an improved depletion of nucleocapsid proteins but, at the same time, may have denatured HN and destroyed HI epitope conformation.Overall our aim to produce MAbs capable to block biologically active sites of the HN protein of genotype 2.VII NDV by using an HN-enriched fraction of purified virus proved to be successful. We obtained a sufficient number of HI-positive MAbs already with a single fusion experiment, and two thirds of the selected hybridoma cultures yielded HN-specific MAbs that were able to block receptor binding.Due to the complex structure of biologically relevant epitopes of the homo-tetrameric HN protein [52] [53] [54] , the approach to generate MAbs reactive with biologically activesites depends on native HN protein with the correct conformation, ideally from virus produced in eukaryotic cells ensuring bona fide glycosylation and folding. Reassuring evidence was obtained through the HI-positive antibody response of two mice immunized with enriched HN preparations. However, in order to select the appropriate antibodies, the screening system has to present the test antigen in its native conformation. When using the indirect ELISA techniques, immobilizing antigen directly to the plastic surfaces of the plates likely interferes with the conformational integrity of the antigen, and important epitopes may be unpredictably masked or exposed [55] . To avoid such structural alterations caused by the coating, Russel and colleagues used NDV infected and formalin fixed cells with']",The aim of producing monoclonal antibodies that block biologically active sites of the HN protein of genotype 2.VII NDV using an HN-enriched fraction of purified virus was successful.,The aim of producing monoclonal antibodies that block biologically active sites of the HN protein of genotype 2.VII NDV using an HN-enriched fraction of purified virus was to generate genotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that can neutralize infectivity and/or block the HA activity of the virus.

A luminance-triggered photodetector output pulse was used to create a temporally precise timestamp upon the presentation of the visual grating.Data from two VSS patients and one control participant were contaminated by metal artefacts from non-removable dental implants or jewellery. Temporal signal space separation (0.9 correlation limit) was used to successfully suppress these artefacts in all cases. 40 The remaining pre-processing was performed using the Fieldtrip toolbox v20191213. 41 For each participant, the entire recording was bandpass filtered between 0.5-250Hz (Butterworth filter, 4 th order, applied bidirectionally) and band-stop filtered to remove residual 50Hz power-line + 2.0s, 3.0s or 4.0s ? 1.0s (max) 1.0s 1.5s contamination and its harmonics. Data were then epoched, based on the onset of the visual grating, into segments of 1.5s pre-and 1.5s post-stimulus onset. To avoid edge artefacts during time-frequency decomposition, an additional 2.5s of data on either side of these timepoints was included as \'padding\'. MEG channels containing large amounts of artefactual data were identified by visual inspection (a maximum of ten channels, per participant, were removed).Trials containing artefacts (SQUID jumps, eye-blinks, head movement) were removed by visual inspection. After pre-processing, there was an average of 109.7 trials (SD=9.1) for the VSS group and 117.4 trials for the control group (SD=2.3). Finally, data were down-sampled to 300Hz to speed computation.As structural MRI scans were not available for all participants, we adopted an alternative approach for MEG-MRI co-registration. The digitised head-shape data were matched with a database of 95 structural MRIs from the human connectome database, 42 using an iterative closest points (ICP) algorithm. The head shape-MRI pair with the lowest ICP error was then used as a \'pseudo-MRI\' for subsequent steps. This procedure has been shown to improve source localisation performance in situations where a subject-specific anatomic MRI is not available. 43, 44 The aligned MRI-MEG image was used to create a forward model based on a single-shell description of the inner surface of the skull. 45 In SPM12, a nonlinear spatial normalisation procedure was used to construct a volumetric grid (8mm resolution) registered to the canonical MNI brain.Source analysis was conducted using a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer, 46 which applies a spatial filter to the MEG data at each point of the 8mm grid. Based on recommendations for optimising MEG beamforming, 47 a regularisation parameter of lambda 5% was used. Beamformer weights were calculated by combining lead-field information with a sensor-level covariance matrix averaged across data from baseline and grating periods. Data were bandpass filtered between 40-70Hz (gamma) and 8-13Hz (alpha), and source analysis was performed separately. To capture induced rather than evoked visual power, a period of 0.3-1.5s following stimulus onset was compared with a 1.2s baseline period (1.5-0.3s before grating onset).To analyse changes in oscillatory power and PAC further, we defined a region of interest in the calcarine sulcus using the AAL atlas, 48 which overlaps with visual area V1. This ROI was chosen based on previous MEG and intracranial recordings, 29, 38, 49, 50 which has established V1 as the primary cortical generator of gamma oscillations following the presentation of visual grating stimuli. For each participant, we selected the grid-point within the calcarine sulcus (parcel names: Calcarine_L; Calcarine_R), which showed the greatest change in gamma power versus baseline.

The RT-PCR test, in which viral nucleic acid is detected, is accepted as the gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. 3 It is reported that COVID-19 infection can be examined in 3 stages, including the first asymptomatic period, secondly the upper and lower respiratory tract response, and then widespread lung involvement that can progress to ARDS. 4 In the COVID-19 disease, approximately 80% of the patients are asymptomatic or limited to mild to moderate symptoms in the first two stages; It is reported that in the remaining 15-20% of the patients, pulmonary ground glass opacity-consolidation is detected as a radiological finding due to the inflammatory response in the lung. 4 If there is no risk factor for the progression of the disease in patients with mild clinical symptoms suspicious for COVID-19, there is no imaging indication, and imaging should be performed in cases with worsening respiratory system symptoms; It has been reported that imaging can be performed to provide medical triage in cases with high suspicion for COVID-19 with moderate-to-severe symptoms if clinical conditions require it. 5 A normal chest X-ray does not exclude COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in cases with mild pneumonia or in the early stage of the disease. 5, 6 It has been reported that CT cannot be used .

259,What percentage of SOT recipients had a positive IgG immune response 6 weeks after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine?,"[""\nDear Editor,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are reported to prevent Covid-19 in 94-95% of adults after a two-dose regimen [1, 2] . However, the immunogenicity in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is currently unknown.As a result of lifelong immunosuppressive treatment, SOT recipients are at a higher risk of severe infections, including Covid-19 [3, 4] .The immunosuppressive treatment affects both the humoral and cellular immune responses with an expected reduced immune response to the Covid-19 vaccine in SOT recipients, as has been previously observed following influenza and pneumococcal vaccination [5, 6] . Previous studies have shown that SOT recipients have a decreased or no immune response following Covid-19 infection [3, 7, 8] . In addition, less than 17% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine was administrated, which increased to 54%, weeks following the second vaccine dose [9, 10 , 11] . It is currently not well described if a twodose regimen of a Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient to elicit an immune response in SOT recipients.Our aim was to investigate the cellular and humoral immune response in SOT recipients following a two-dose regimen of Covid-19 vaccination.All SOT recipients (≥18 years of age) from the Region of Southern Denmark were invited to participate in the study since 29 January 2021 (Danish Ethical Committee, record no. 77786). All the participants received vaccination as part of the national Covid-19 vaccination program and the SOT recipients were identified as a prioritized target group.Blood samples were drawn 6 weeks following the second vaccination. The SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 IgG response was measured by a semiquantitative EUROIMMUN SARS-COV-2 ELISA assay (FDA approved). Test results were interpreted according to the manufacturer; ratios ≤0.8 were interpreted as negative, 0.8 to <1.1 as borderline, and ≥1.1 as positive. For this study, values >0.8 were reported as positive. T-cell response was measured by the interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot Qiagen QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay (research use only), which includes specific SARS-CoV-2 peptides pool from spike antigen (S1 and S2 subunits). The cut-off for a positive response was set at 0.15 (personal communication with Qiagen).Categorical data was described by total and percentages. Data comparisons were made using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Continuous variables were described as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. A p-value of less than 0.05 (5%) was considered statistically significant.A total of 663 SOT recipients were identified and 423 consented to be included in the study. We report the preliminary results of the humoral and cellular immune responses in our ongoing study including the first 80 SOT recipients, who completed the two-dose vaccine regimen. All but one SOT recipient received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine (n = 79).The median age was 58.9 years (IQR: 47.9-66.8) with 55.0% (44/80) being males. The majority of SOT recipients were kidney transplant recipients (65.0%).The median time from second vaccination to antibody testing was 5.6 weeks (IQR 5.1-6.3). The median IgG antibody response was 0.3 (IQR 0.2-2.7). The QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay was positive in five (6.3%) SOT recipients. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics stratified by SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG immune response. Only 35.0% (n = 28) were able to mount a positive IgG immune response 6 weeks after the second dose of vaccine (Fig. 1) . Vaccine responders were significantly younger than non-responders (p < 0.01). All SOT recipients were treated with a combination of at least two immunosuppressive drugs. A total of 61 SOT recipients received proliferation inhibitors and the proportion of non-responders was significantly higher in this group (p < 0.01). Covid-19 infection was not diagnosed in any of the SOT recipients before or after vaccination.This study provides insights into the limitations of immunization following a two-dose regimen of Covid-19 mRNA vaccine in SOT recipients. The key finding was a reduced antibody response 6 weeks after the second vaccination, with only 35% of""]",35%,35.0% (n = 28) of SOT recipients had a positive IgG immune response 6 weeks after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.,What percentage of SOT recipients had a positive IgG immune response 6 weeks after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine? ->: 35.0% (n = 28) of SOT recipients had a positive IgG immune response 6 weeks after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.,"According to the provided data, 75% of SOT recipients had a positive IgG immune response 6 weeks after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine."
252,What is the correlation between starting antibody levels and the duration of the response to COVID-19?,"[' 6 months after vaccination had dropped similarly to those 6 months after natural infection. At this 6 month interval, there was again no correlation between AUC and neutralization titers for the Pfizer vaccine (Pearson r = 0.4580, p = 0.2538). Since the Moderna vaccine was more recently available, similar 6 month data for this vaccine are not yet available. Thus, while the vaccines clearly induce a very strong antibody response, the capacity of these antibodies to neutralize is lower than would be expected based on the correlation between AUC and neutralization generated with sera from natural infection. Finally, Figure 5A ,C suggests that when individuals with prior infection are vaccinated, their antibody levels may be higher and more neutralizing than vaccination alone. Altogether, our data suggest that people who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or have detectible antibodies resulting from natural infection may have low-level antibodies that are not necessarily neutralizing, robust, or long-lasting. This population will still greatly benefit from vaccination that induces a higher magnitude antibody response than natural infection. The interval between serum collection and natural infection or vaccination was comparable. Notably, sera collected from those infected in March had a longer interval compared to those collected in July or later, but retained a similar average AUC.

Our study is novel in a number of aspects. We determined a temporal difference in antibody responses in our community and measured antibody responses over twelve months, allowing for the calculation of a strong correlation between starting levels of antibodies and the duration of the response. We also directly compared the antibody responses of those vaccinated with two different vaccines to those of naturally infected participants. We utilized a highly sensitive and specific ELISA assay to determine the antibody levels in a population that was not necessarily diagnosed with COVID-19. We determined that most, but not all, participants with a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis had detectible neutralizing antibody titers and detected a small number of participants that had no known COVID-19 interactions and no diagnosis but had low titer non-neutralizing antibodies. A similar study also determined that a high proportion of asymptomatic patients did not develop neutralizing antibodies, or lost them quickly [28] . Many investigations involve severely ill or hospitalized individuals and not a majority of asymptomatic people [10']",The correlation between starting antibody levels and the duration of the response to COVID-19 is strong.,"The correlation between starting antibody levels and the duration of the response to COVID-19 suggests that individuals with higher starting antibody levels tend to have a longer measurable antibody response.

0,How can the serum half-life of nanobody candidates be increased using anti-human serum albumin?,"[' , at the cost of a shortened in vivo half-life. Hence, in such a case, options to elongate the half-life of nanobody candidates should be taken before moving to the clinic. These may include linking a nanobody to anti-human serum albumin (HSA), a technique that has been proven to increase the serum half-life to~6 days in cynomolgus monkeys [112] . Another strategy to circumvent ADE is the introduction of a LALA mutation (Leu234Ala together with Leu235Ala) into the Fc to minimize FcR activation and Fc-mediated toxicity of human antibody candidates against SARS-CoV-2. This has been done with JS016 (currently in clinical trial) which employs a LALA mutation in the Fc to minimize FcγR activation and Fcmediated toxicity, and also with antibody CB6 where CB6-LALA is currently being investigated in clinical trials (Table 1 ) [71] .We are currently experiencing an explosion of research into antibodies to combat COVID-19 that include neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1 ) and therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. To date, 8 neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical evaluation -LY-CoV555, JS016, REGN-COV2, TY027, BRII-196, BRII-198, CT-P59, and SCTA01. It is understood that SARS-CoV-2 may develop resistance to a single neutralizing antibody by accumulating spontaneous mutations [88, 89] . To overcome this problem, antibody cocktails such as REGN-COV2, AZD7442, and COVI-SHIELD have entered clinical trials (Table 1) . Further, multiple research programs have also started to work on antibodies against conserved epitopes that would avoid the SARS-CoV-2 mutations that are currently being observed in the pandemic. This will enable us to get ahead of the potential issue of viral resistance [53, 81, 88, 89, 113, 114] . Efforts will also be necessary to discover conserved functional neutralizing epitopes that, once mutated, can cause SARS-CoV-2 to lose its infectivity. To circumvent the potential problem of ADE, several strategies are being explored, including the use of nanobodies lacking the Fc domain and the introduction of the LALA mutation into the Fc domain.Given the development of fruitful concurrent pipelines of antibodies against COVID-19 driven by close collaboration between academia and industry, we hold optimism that broadly neutralizing candidates will emerge that induce less or no ADE, and thus play a major role in therapy and protection against COVID-19. Over the next few years we are likely to see an expansion of preclinical research and gain extensive experience in the development of antibodies against COVID-19 in the clinic. An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 will better prepare us for the next pandemic (see Outstanding Questions).We thank Dr Shaolei Teng (Howard University) for sharing the analysis of mutations on S protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Of interest an in-silico docking study found significant binding of kinase inhibitors like upadacitinib to the RNA dependent RNA polymerase kinase-like folded NiRAN domain. 135 JAKi most in use in hematology patients Ruxolitinib Ruxolitinib is a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor used for around 10 years in the clinics for the treatment of MPNs MF and PV.In general, hematological cancer patients exhibit enhanced mortality on SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with healthy individuals. 136 137 A cohort study in Wuhan on hospitalized hematological cancer patients showed an incidence of 10% that developed COVID-19 infection. While the incidence was relatively similar to that in healthcare providers (7%), the mortality rate of hematological patients (no MPN in the study) was increased to 62% vs 0% of healthcare providers, 138 estimated 41 times higher than hematological patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection. 139 Interestingly, a lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection was recorded both in China and elsewhere for BCR/ABL1 positive chronic myeloid leukemia. 137 140 However, no significant attenuation of T cell response was detected in MPN patients compared with healthy subjects. 141 Ruxolitinib was tested in several clinical settings, from one patient studies to phase 3 clinical trials (table 1, ClinicalTrials. gov). However, although a positive impression first came from case reports or small, uncontrolled or non-randomized cases series 142-148 that ruxolitinib might be helpful to fight COVID-19, these results were not confirmed in larger randomized trials. Press releases have been issued after the results of two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with the use of ruxolitinib in hospitalized non-ventilated patients (RUXCOVID, NCT04362137) and in ventilated patients (RUXCOVID-DEVENT, NCT04377620). Neither study met its primary endpoint. In the RUXCOVID study, 432 patients were enrolled. The results showed no improvement in the proportion of patients who experienced death, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit, by day 29 for patients receiving ruxolitinib 5 mg bidaily compared with those receiving standard of care alone (12.0% vs 11.8%; p=0.769). There was also no clinically relevant benefit in mortality rate by day 29 or in time to recovery.The phase 3 RUXCOVID-DEVENT study evaluated ruxolitinib 5 mg bidaily or 15 mg bidaily as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS on mechanical ventilation. There was no statistically significant improvement in mortality through day 29 compared with placebo. However, when US study participants were analyzed separately there was significance, as it also could be detected for the overall population when data from both treatment arms were pooled. The safety findings in both RUXCOVID and in RUXCOVID-DEVENT were consistent with those expected for ruxolitinib and for patients with COVID-19 infection.The development of ruxolitinib in the COVID-19 setting has not proceeded after these results 149 and ruxolitinib has not be retained by the WHO 128 or other drug agencies as a drug to be used in the setting of COVID-19.Many reasons could explain the fact that ruxolitinib, which has the same spectrum of JAKs inhibition as baricitinib, did not improve patients with COVID-19. One would be that BenevolentAI did not predict ruxolitinib as having a possible impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Furthermore, it is not clear if patients in the RUXCOVID and RUXCOVID-DEVENT trials were constantly on antiviral therapy. Nevertheless, coadministration of remdesivir with baricitinib in the COV-BARRIER trial concerned less than 20% of the patients and the placebo and test arms were appropriately balanced. 124 Hence, it is unlikely that it influenced the results of the study. Doses of ruxolitinib in the RUXCOVID trial were also lower than in most publications, but higher doses did not improve outcome in the RUXCOVID-DEVENT trial. As for the best time of intervention, no phase 3 study evaluated early treatment with ruxolitinib but both RUXCOVID and RUXCOVID-DEVENT studied different time of evolution of the disease and neither met its endpoint. Finally, best efficacy of baricitinib or tofacitinib is achieved in combination with corticosteroids, and such combination was not studied in a dedicated trial in the case of ruxolitinib. Once again however, publications mainly focus on trials with positive ending.

100,How does the phase-type distribution affect the SAIRS model with vaccination in a random dynamical system with semi-Markov switching?,"[' there exists a constant ε i ą 0 such thatfor all t P r0, 8q. In [15] , the authors provide a list of some probability distributions satisfying the assumption (H1), and show that the constraint conditions of (H1) are very weak. Specifically, they provide the phase-type distribution (PH-distribution) of a nonnegative random variable, and prove that this PH-distribution, or at most an approximation of it, satisfies the conditions in (H1). Thus, they conclude that essentially the conditional holding time distribution of the semi-Markov process can be any distribution on r0, 8q. Remark 1. Let us note that in the case of exponential (memoryless) sojourn time distribution, the semi-Markov process trptq, t ě 0u degenerates into a continuous time Markov chain. That is, if F i ptq "" 1´e´q it for some q i ą 0, i P M, thenfor all t P r0, 8q, from whichwhere q i,j is the transition rates from state i to state j, and q i,Thus, the matrix Q "" pq i,j q mˆm generates the Markov chain trptq, t ě 0u, i.e.,where ∆t ą 0 represents a small time increment. By the assumptions (H1) follows that the matrix Q is irreducible. Under this condition, the Markov chain has a unique stationary positive probability distribution π "" pπ 1 , . . . , π m q T which can be determined by solving the following linear equation π T Q "" 0, subject to ř M r""1 π r "" 1, and π r ą 0, @r P M. Let us introduce the process ηptq "" t´suptu ă t : rpuq ‰ rptqu, which represents the amount of time the process trptq, t ě 0u is at the current state after the last jump. It is also denoted as the backward recurrence time process. The pair tpηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u satisfies the Markov property [17] , moreover it is strong Markov [10, Chapter 6].Let us consider a SAIRS model with vaccination, as in [20] .Let us now incorporate the impact of the external random environments into system (1) . We assume that the external random environment is described by a semi-Markov process. We only consider the environmental influence on the disease transmission rate since it may be more sensitive to environmental fluctuations than other parameters of model (1) . Thus, the average value of the transmission rate may switch between different levels with the switching of the environmental regimes. As a result, the SAIRS deterministic model (1) evolves in a random dynamical system with semi-Markov switching of the formLet us introduceβ :"" pβ A , β I q. If the initial conditions of the driving process tpηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u are ηp0q "" 0 and rp0q "" r 0 , then system (2) starts from the initial condition pSp0q, Ap0q, Ip0q, Rp0qq and follows (1) withβ ""βpr 0 q until the first jump time τ 1 , with conditional holding distribution F r0 p¨q. Then, the environmental regime switches instantaneously from state r 0 to state r 1 ; thus, the process restarts from the state r 1 and the system evolves accordingly to (1) withβ ""βpr 1 q and distribution F r1 p¨q until the next jump time τ 2 . The system will evolve in the similar way as long as the semi-Markov process jumps. This yields a continuous and piecewise smooth trajectory in R 4 . Let us note that the solution process txptq "" pSptq, Aptq, Iptq, Rptqq, t ě 0u that records the position of the switching trajectory of (2) is not Markov. However, by means of additional components, tpxptq, ηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u is a homogeneous Markov process.In this paper, unless otherwise specified, let pΩ, F , tF t u tě0 , Pq be a complete probability space with a filtration tF t u tě0 satisfying the usual conditions (i.e. it is right continuous and F 0 contains all P-null sets).Since S`A`I`R "" 1, system (2) is equivalent to the following three-dimensional dynamical system:with initial condition pSp0q, Ap0q, Ip0qq']",The phase-type distribution affects the SAIRS model with vaccination in a random dynamical system with semi-Markov switching by determining the distribution of the conditional holding time and the switching of the environmental regimes.,"The phase-type distribution does not appear to be specifically mentioned in the provided context.

The phase-type distribution affects the SAIRS model with vaccination in a random dynamical system with semi-Markov switching by influencing the transition probabilities between the different compartments in the system.

The suspension was centrifuged (20 min at 10,000×g, 9703 rpm, A-4-81-11 Rotor, (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany)) and the obtained pellet (p1) was resuspended in 1 mL PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.2) and kept for analysis, whereas the supernatant was further cleared by ultra-centrifugation at high speed (1 h at 200,000×g, 55,000 rpm Rotor TSL 55 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA)) for 1 h. Again the pellet (p2) was kept for analysis after resuspension in 0.2 mL PBS. The supernatant was collected and dialyzed against 0.01 M phosphate buffer in order to remove the potassium chloride from the buffer used during purification.

190,"How does flexible imitation contribute to epidemic suppression, considering vaccination and feedback mechanisms?","['Flexible imitation suppresses epidemics through better vaccination\nThe development of vaccines is one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. They save millions of lives yearly, not only by giving immunity to people exposed to an infection but also by stopping disease outbreaks. Most famously, perhaps, vaccine drove the eradication of smallpox. [1] At the time of writing, vaccines are the main hope for a pharmaceutical solution to the COVID-19 crisis. [2] [3] [4] To be able to evaluate interventions involving vaccination, we need to model the selection of who gets vaccinated and how that affects epidemics. [5] Creating such models is a very challenging task to which this paper seeks to contribute. [6, 7] The main difficulty lies in the complex feedback mechanisms between the epidemics itself and the decision to get vaccinated. [8] [9] [10] Not only are there irrational anti-vaccination sentiments that themselves spread through social contagion, [11, 12] but sometimes not getting vaccinated is a perfectly rational choice.When the population level of immunity is high enough, an outbreak will die out by itself. If this is the case, the population is said to have herd immunity. Even if the vaccine is effective, the marginal benefit of getting vaccinated in a society with herd immunity is small. [13] On top of this, a vaccine could be costly, inefficient, laden with side-effects, or inconvenient to administer. [14] For an individual, the reality is often between these extremes and not a choice between a cheap lifesaver or a costly unnecessity. Thus, this choice is known in the literature as the vaccination dilemma. [15, 16] Assume the vaccine is effective but has some side-effects (although much milder than the disease itself). Then one can model the rational-choice aspect of vaccination within * holme@cns.pi.titech.ac.jp the framework of game theory. [7, 17] As often is the case, behavioural and economic game theorists both take an interest in this problem, with somewhat different starting points. The behavioural game-theory line of research typically focuses on herd immunity as a public goodsomething valuable and accessible without competition to anyone in society. [9, 10] Like other public goods, herd immunity is prone to free-riding people who undermine the good by avoiding vaccination. [18] Economic game theorists instead think of vaccination as a decision based on an individual\'s costs and benefits, and regard herd immunity as a positive externality. The truth lies in between these pictures. [8] Benefiting a public good is not the most common driving force behind an individual\'s vaccination decisions. [19, 20] It would also make little sense to get vaccinated to contribute to herd immunity if very few others were vaccinated, which is precisely when the private benefits are the largest. [13] On the other hand, herd immunity and, ultimately, eradication of a disease are the primary goals at a national level, [3, 4] and thus more than a mere externality.There is a growing research interest in game-theoretic studies of vaccination. [6, 17] For articles in the economic game-theory literature, see e.g. Geoffard and Philipson [8] or Francis [13] and further references therein. In the evolutionary game-theory literature, early works coupled game theory and epidemic dynamics by differential-equation based models. [21] Later, authors recognised that social interaction structures are better modelled by networks. For example, in Fu et al. [15] individuals compare their fitness to randomly selected network neighbours to determine whether or not to imitate the neighbour. The phrases ""fitness"" and ""payoff"" (that in this paper are synonymous) come from the gametheory literature and capture the ability to avoid infection minus the cost associated with the vaccination. Other authors have extended the use of imitation dynamics. Zhang et al. [22] , for example, considered the possibility that deci-arXiv:2009.00443v2 [q-bio.PE] 12 Oct 2020 The plots also show two initial fractions of conformists, c = 0.5 (blue curves) and c = 0.9 (yellow curves). The population seems unable (respectively, able) to eventually reduce the outbreak size irrespective of the memory length when the initial fraction of conformists is high (moderate). Short (long) memory seems insufficient (sufficient) to trigger a substantial interchange of imitation mechanisms among individuals compared to the initial state. Long memory thus helps to eliminate outbreaks when the initial fraction of conformists is moderate (blue curve in panel (b)). Here, the infection rate is relatively large, β = 2. The networks are constructed by the Erdős-Rényi model with N = 64 nodes and the average degree k = 2, which ensures the existence of a giant component (that essentially all nodes belong to). Time is measured in the']",Flexible imitation contributes to epidemic suppression by considering vaccination and feedback mechanisms.,"Flexible imitation contributes to epidemic suppression through the process of vaccination and feedback mechanisms. In the context of the study, individuals have the ability to choose between conformist and performist imitation strategies when deciding whether or not to vaccinate. This flexibility allows individuals to observe their social surroundings and update their imitation mechanisms based on experience. By incorporating flexible imitation into the decision-making process for vaccination, individuals can better assess the situation and make informed choices based on available information.

Additionally, the study suggests that having a moderate level of initial conformism is most effective in terms of outbreak size reduction, especially at large infection rates. This indicates that allowing for some level of conformity in decision-making, while also being open to other strategies, can help improve vaccination coverage and ultimately contribute to epidemic suppression.

Moreover, the research highlights the importance of educational measures to increase awareness about the role of vaccines in controlling infectious diseases. By extending the model to include individuals who do not let social dynamics influence their choices, such as zealots, and by promoting collective awareness through educational initiatives, the vaccination coverage and epidemic suppression can be enhanced.

In summary, flexible imitation in vaccination decision-making, along with feedback mechanisms and educational efforts, can play a significant role in suppressing epidemics by improving vaccination coverage and reducing outbreak sizes.","How does flexible imitation contribute to epidemic suppression, considering vaccination and feedback mechanisms? ->: Flexible imitation contributes to epidemic suppression through the process of vaccination and feedback mechanisms.

Flexible imitation can contribute to epidemic suppression by promoting the adoption of vaccination and feedback mechanisms.

This is because vaccination and feedback mechanisms can help to reduce the number of susceptible individuals in a population, which"
98,"What does the JAK-STAT pathway do in autoimmune diseases, pathological inflammatory conditions, and COVID-19?","[' (CALR) 68 69 that endow mutated CALR proteins the ability to bind and activate the same TpoR in the absence of ligand. [70] [71] [72] [73] Thus, for this very large group of diseases with increasing prevalence (0.4-0.7/1000, 5 times higher than chronic myeloid leukemia induced by the BCR-Abelson kinase (ABL) fusion protein) the cause is persistent activation of JAK2 in clonal HSCs, which gives a major advantage to progenitors of red blood cells, platelets and granulocytes, leading to clonal expansion of these lineages in the absence of cytokines.In the same time with the identification of JAK2 V617F it was shown that homologous mutations activate constitutively JAK1 (V658F) and TYK2 (V678F) 66 and these and other activating mutations were identified in T-acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL), in B-ALL and several other conditions. 74 75 Overall, these findings provided an impetus to search for potent inhibitors of JAKs.The second reason why JAKs became prime targets for the pharmaceutical industry is represented by excessive activation of cytokines and their receptors in autoimmune diseases. The prime targets were members of the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21 and especially the two JAK proteins associated with subunits of this group, namely JAK1 and JAK3. 76 Inhibitors were thus seeked that could inhibit JAK1 and JAK3, or only JAK3. Such inhibitors were discovered and it was found that only inhibiting JAK3 exerts a much weaker effect than inhibiting JAK1 and JAK3, implying that JAK1 is the dominant JAK, 77 and that JAK3 needs to be present in the complex, as a scaffold, but its catalytic activity is not as crucial as that of JAK1. 77 78 Indeed, absence of JAK3 has a blocking effect while inhibiting the kinase domain only exerts a minor effect. 77 79 More recently, increased interest in JAKi strategies arose for the need of new treatments for pathological inflammatory conditions like hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) where overactive T cells and macrophages secrete numerous proinflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18 and TNF-α, involving the JAK-STAT pathway. 80 Samewise in COVID-19, the JAK-STAT pathway is implicated in complement hyperactivation in SARS-CoV-2-infected respiratory epithelial cells 81 and in the activation of CD4 + and CD8 + positive T cells, NK cells and monocytes which cooperate with elevated levels of IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-17. Indeed, very high levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-α and G-CSF were described in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care. 82 Furthermore, JAK-STAT activation promotes senescence of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, which amplifies inflammation. 83 Therefore, JAKi, and especially JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, were suggested as a potential therapy against systemic inflammation in COVID-19 84 because treatment with a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor to prevent lung injury in severe COVID-19 would be able to reduce cytokine action more effectively than blocking one cytokine at a time (like IL-6. 85 The major strategy used for obtaining kinase inhibitors is to obtain compounds that prevent ATP entrance in the ATP binding pocket. ATP is obligatory as a source of phosphate for catalysis. The small molecule inhibitor may bind and compete with ATP, or may bind to close-by sites or distant sites that allosterically prevent ATP binding to the ATP pocket. The kinase inhibitors may bind to active kinases and inhibit them (type I) or may bind to the inactive kinase, and block the transition to active kinase (type II). 86 The very well-known kinase inhibitor imatinib inhibits the Abelson kinase (ABL), PDGF receptor and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases. Imatinib binds to kinases when they are inactive (type II), thus preventing activation. All current JAKi used in the clinics so far are type I inhibitors, and they only recognize and bind kinase domain of JAKs in their active conformation. This is on one hand a limitation, as prebinding activation is a prerequisite for binding, hence pathological signaling occurs at a certain point, but on the other hand the', 'Open access JAK inhibitors and COVID-19\nDuring SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response can be inhibited or delayed, and the subsequent persistent viral replication can induce emergency signals that may culminate in a cytokine storm contributing to the severe evolution of COVID-19. Cytokines are key regulators of the immune response and virus clearance, and, as such, are linked to the-possibly altered-response to the SARS-CoV-2. They act via a family of more than 40 transmembrane receptors that are coupled to one or several of the 4 Janus kinases (JAKs) coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Once activated, JAKs act on pathways for either survival, proliferation, differentiation, immune regulation or, in the case of type I interferons, antiviral and antiproliferative effects. Studies of graft-versus-host and systemic rheumatic diseases indicated that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) exert immunosuppressive effects that are non-redundant with those of corticotherapy. Therefore, they hold the potential to cut-off pathological reactions in COVID-19. Significant clinical experience already exists with several JAKi in COVID-19, such as baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and nezulcitinib, which were suggested by a meta-analysis (Patoulias et al.) to exert a benefit in terms of risk reduction concerning major outcomes when added to standard of care in patients with COVID-19. Yet, only baricitinib is recommended in first line for severe COVID-19 treatment by the WHO, as it is the only JAKi that has proven efficient to reduce mortality in individual randomized clinical trials (RCT), especially the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) and COV-BARRIER phase 3 trials. As for secondary effects of JAKi treatment, the main caution with baricitinib consists in the induced immunosuppression as long-term side effects should not be an issue in patients treated for COVID-19. We discuss whether a class effect of JAKi may be emerging in COVID-19 treatment, although at the moment the convincing data are for baricitinib only. Given the key role of JAK1 in both type I IFN action and signaling by cytokines involved in pathogenic effects, establishing the precise timing of treatment will be very important in future trials, along with the control of viral replication by associating antiviral molecules.Cytokine receptors and the Janus kinase-signal transducers and Activators of transcription pathway Cytokines are alpha-helical proteins of [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] aminoacids that are secreted and act on target cells as a function of expression and exposure on their surface of specific receptors. They are fundamentally required for blood formation and regulation of the immune response. In blood formation, on commitment to differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), lineage specific cytokines regulate the survival, proliferation and differentiation of progenitors and the final blood levels. 1 Cytokines act via specific cytokine receptors. The human genome codes for over 40 cytokine receptors. They all signal via Janus kinases (JAKs), initially called Just Another Kinases, that are appended non-covalently to their cytosolic tails. Four JAKs are coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Activated receptors induce via JAKs the activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). There are 7 STATs coded by the human genome. Several receptors use the same JAKs and sharing of JAKs allows specific signals by the different receptors and cytokines, but different outputs. 1 The cytokine receptor superfamily is divided in type 1 and type 2 families (figure 1) and this distinction is derived from different sequence features, such as conserved WSXWS motifs in the extracellular domains and boxes 1 and 2 motifs in the cytosolic domains for type 1 (figure 2A). 1 The type 1 family consists of homodimeric receptors (for Epo, Tpo, GCSF, Growth Hormone, Prolactin), heterodimeric receptors (for IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF), using JAK2, hetero-oligomeric receptors, using JAK1 and to some extent JAK2 and TYK2 (represented by the IL6 family receptors), 2 and finally the gamma chain using receptors (namely those for IL']","The JAK-STAT pathway is implicated in autoimmune diseases, pathological inflammatory conditions, and COVID-19.","The JAK-STAT pathway plays a crucial role in autoimmune diseases, pathological inflammatory conditions, and COVID-19 by regulating immune responses and cytokine signaling.

36,What are the factors associated with vaccine hesitancy in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic?,"['\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was first confirmed in China in December 2019, causing pneumonia and other respiratory diseases, and rapidly spreading worldwide, with a cumulative total of 400,846,690 confirmed cases and 5,764,834 deaths as of 9 February 2022 [1]. Given its high prevalence, an effective vaccine would play a critical role in preventing the spread of COVID-19 [2] . Many efforts have been made to develop vaccines, including the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech, New York, NY, USA), mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Cambridge, UK), Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA), and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, Beijing, China), which were approved by the World Health Organization [3] . However, vaccine hesitancy has been observed worldwide and is a major obstacle in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic [4] [5] [6] [7] . In addition, there are concerns that the neutralizing activity of a vaccine may decrease over time, even in individuals who have received two doses of the vaccine. It was reported that six months after the administration of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, the humoral response was substantially reduced [8] . In several jurisdictions, booster vaccinations have been authorized by the regulatory authorities [9]. The booster vaccination dose level is the same in the BNT162b2 vaccine and half the level in the mRNA-1273 vaccine compared to the dose in the primary vaccination series. As described above, reducing the number of unvaccinated individuals, as well as minimizing vaccine hesitancy to facilitate more people receiving a third dose, is an extremely important measure in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.Previous studies examined the factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Ethnicity, work status, religion, politics, sex, age, education, and income were reported to be factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [10, 11] . However, information on the factors affecting COVID-19 booster vaccine hesitancy among fully-vaccinated individuals is limited [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .Fukushima Prefecture experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases between August 2021 and January 2022, wherein a total of 17,327 cases, equivalent to 194 cases per 100,000 people, were reported by 9 February 2022 [17] . BNT162b2 vaccinations were offered beginning March 2021 to healthcare workers, older adults, people with comorbidities, and the general population. A total of 81.7% of the population aged ≥12 years who were eligible for vaccination received second doses by 2 February 2022. A third vaccination dose was offered from1 December 2021 to healthcare workers and residents of geriatric facilities who had been vaccinated with either the BNT162b2 vaccine or the mRNA-1273 vaccine at least six months earlier, and adults aged 65 years or older who had been vaccinated for at least eight months. In Japan, 3.96% of the population received a third dose by 3 February 2022, which is the lowest among the OECD member countries. In Fukushima Prefecture, 5.1% of the total population received a third dose as of 3 February 2022 [18] . In addition, certain disaster-affected populations in Fukushima have been continuously subjected to COVID-19 antibody titer monitoring to develop infection prevention measures accordingly [19, 20] . This area had an advantage in that the residents were aware of the level of their own humoral immunity after vaccination and how it had evolved, allowing assessment of how this affected their behavior regarding the third vaccination.The purpose of this study was to investigate factors associated with hesitancy over a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in order to increase the booster contact rate required to control the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was supported by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development and was conducted as part of the FVCS, a study carried out to evaluate antibody titer dynamics after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine and the mRNA-1273 vaccine in rural communities in Japan.A total of three participants received two doses of mRNA-1273 and all other participants received two doses of BNT162b2. All the participants who received mRNA-1273 were non-healthcare workers. The vaccination dose was the same for all the participants. The blood sampling was performed between 8 September and 8 October 2021. The mean (SD) of the interval days between the second dose of the vaccination and the serological tests was 180.5 (±32.2) days, ranging from 64 to 252 days.

61,What is the debate surrounding the conscience and practitioner's right to determine morally objectionable procedures?,"['Pellagrino 1995 (Pellagrino , 1997 , the result in many jurisdictions has been less collaborative than coercive, with the role of employers (state or private) dominating as the sole appropriate voice for concerns over care and treatment. Where active, many professional organizations have been largely silent in the face of ethical disagreement or, as the Strom case suggests, complicit. Their role as advocates for practitioners and a more traditional social ethic varies, obviously, country to country and, in some nations, by province or state.One sees the effect of these changes in the contemporary debate over ""conscience"" and the practitioner\'s right to determine what are medically inappropriate or, for them morally objectionable procedures. Influential bioethicists like Canada\'s Udo Schüklenk and Great Britain\'s Julian Savulescu recently argued patients need to be protected from morally grounded physicians exercising conscientious objectionsor even informed opinions-on the advisability of specific procedures (Savulescu and Schüklenk 2017) . Simply, they argue, that if it is legal then there is a duty to its performance. ""If this leads to feelings of guilty remorse, or them dropping out of the profession, so be it"" (Blackwell 2016) . And yet, as others have noted, ""The mere fact that something is illegal or legal does not make it immoral or moral"" (Blumenthal- Barby et al. 2021) . Legalities change and physicians have the right, and some would say obligation, to follow both personal ethics and professional guidelines in their practices.In each of the cases earlier presented the practitioners spoke publicly as informed professionals concerned with issues of public health. It was, however, precisely because they spoke publicly as practitioners that they were penalized. But it was because they were knowledgeable practitioners that their comments were important.If similar questions had been raised by others without that background … who would listen? As their public standing was diminished, so, too, was the right to conscience, to object publicly to procedures, policies and programs perceived as inappropriate. Practitioners were thus reduced to silent functionaries whose sole responsibility was to bureaucratic superiors and their policies irrespective of the effect on patients and public health. As a result the relational nature of medicine, of decisions made by practitioners in association with and for patients, is subverted (Deutscher et al. 2019) . Increasingly the argument is, as Hastings Center cofounder and bioethicist Daniel Callahan long argued, in a work earlier cited, they must first be ""stewards"" of diminished health resources rather than advocates for patients in need or society at large.This type of critique and review is, to social and political science, what a differential diagnosis is to medicine. It identifies and then organizes symptoms and tracks where possible their origins across a particular history to a conclusion. It presents a snapshot of systems that are not immutable, creatures of a history that can be changed. The advancement of organizational concerns advanced by a utilitarian, body politic can be challenged and perhaps transformed. The role of practitioners to voice concerns on the basis of experience can be lauded rather than challenged as, at best, inconvenient.

177,"What factors influence coalition building, according to the context?","["" foster connections between movements, even those that are not in the same area (Soule 2013; Rose 2000) . In her study of coalition building in the anti-death-penalty movement, Jones (2010) shows that coalition projects focused on bridge-building between different grassroots anti-death-penalty communities, creating an effective model of advocacy on behalf of persons facing the death penalty. Another example is the study by Tomazini et al. (2016) focusing on the alliance between social movements and institutional actors engaged in advocacy for food security, in which collaboration was only possible due to the participants' strong and diverse ties with progressive parties.Several studies have indicated that a shared ideological orientation (Enriquez 2014; Cullen 2005 ; van Dyke 2003) , cultural similarities between movements (Jung et al. 2014; Bandy and Smith 2004) and similar identities (Corrigall-Brown and Meyer 2010; Heaney and Rojas 2014) aid coalition formation. As suggested by van Dyke and McCammon (2010) , ideological congruence is a critical condition that, in some cases, is sufficient to inspire a coalition. Research has also investigated the inverse: different ideologies hinder coalition formation (Polanska and Piotrowski 2015; Tarrow and Meyer 2018) . However, it has been shown that common ideological grounds may not suffice as a condition for a coalition to work. A number of studies have shown that even when organizations share common goals and ideologies, and are also aware of one another, they still do not engage in collaboration (Soule 2013) . Nevertheless, some organizations are able to find a common ground. As an example, the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, in which members of some of the organizations do not embrace climate justice, has built upon the work of the Working Group on Climate Change. Based on their shared understanding of the range of causes and implications of climate change in the Global South, participants in the coalition were able to create a common ground around the various groups (Saunders 2008) .Political threats are powerful motivators when it comes to collective action and one of the most powerful incentives for coalition formation (van Dyke and Amos 2017). As already established by political opportunity theory, the factors that are conducive to uniting the efforts of distinct groups of actors usually combine threats (Almeida 2010; Juskas and Edwards 2005; Tarrow 2005 ) and opportunities and also the availability of resources that organizations lack (Heaney and Rojas 2014).As shown above, it is now well established from a wide range of studies that those factors (ideology, interactions, political context) influence the formation and success of coalitions. Taken together, these studies outline a critical role for research focused on the dynamics of coalition formation, as they allow us to see what elements need to be present for a coalition to succeed. However, they do little in terms of explaining other features that impact coalition maintenance and outcomes. I build on this previous framework to explore other emergent elements, such as cooperation, respectful interaction, the connecting of actors, and outcomes as the next step forward towards a better understanding of coalition longevity and outcomes that have been less discussed in the literature.A comparative approach was chosen for this research for two reasons. First, it allowed for a cross-national investigation of the factors influencing coalition maintenance and longevity. Second, the comparative element enables a narrative that provides 'concrete knowledge about specific processes' (Della Porta 2012) from specific country contexts. Besides epitomizing the current trend of housing unaffordability in Europe following years of economic austerity, Dublin and Lisbon are two European capital cities where there are energetic housing movements. These movements have attracted plenty of attention to housing issues, such as the increase in homelessness, gentrification, and skyrocketing rents.The empirical analysis is based on interviews with housing activists, field observation of meetings and events, and documents produced by activists posted on websites and social media. The interviews were semi-structured, allowing for themes to emerge while following a standard interview script. All 45 interviews were recorded with the consent of the participants and anonymized during the data analysis. Interviews lasted between 50 min and one hour and a half. They took place in neutral locations between January and June 2019. Participants were chosen using a non-random approach based on the respondent's involvement in housing mobilization. The sample included housing group members, elected politicians, homelessness NGO representatives, and activists. During the interviews, participants talked about their experiences in the housing movement, the coalitions they participate in, and their perception of success and challenges in housing mobilization. Interviews were transcribed and coded using NVivo, a qualitative software. Later, code and sub-codes were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach (Saldaña 2009) . A descriptive element was adopted to explain the dynamics of each coalition (see Wendt 1998) .This research draws on data collected from two housing coalitions formed to address the housing crisis: Raise the Roof (RTR) in Dublin and Morar Em Lisboa (Living in Lisbon-""]","The factors that influence coalition building, according to the context, include shared ideological orientation, cultural similarities between movements, similar identities, common goals and ideologies, awareness of one another, political threats, opportunities, and availability of resources.","According to the context provided, the factors that influence coalition building include political context, social ties, shared ideology, available resources, the presence of ""bridge builders"" or ""coalition brokers,"" threats and opportunities, as well as the ability to find common ground and coordinate actions.

170,"What are the performance advantages of COVIDSum compared to other summarization models, and what factors contribute to its improvements according to the results and evaluations?","['ERT, PEGASUS-Large and COVIDSum) all achieve performance gains over the above three approaches. BERTSumAbs is the sequence-to-sequence baseline with BERT as encoder and Transformer as decoder, the prior knowledge injected during the pre-training process ensures its performance improvements. HIBERT pre-trains a hierarchical encoder and applies it in an extractive summarization model. However, since training of HIBERT demands the manual labels of target sentences, the quality of labels limits its capability. By incorporating linguistic knowledge, the word co-occurrence relationships specifically, to the summarization model, our proposed COVIDSum achieves the highest ROUGE scores comparing with the other comparing summarization methods. PEGASUS-Large losses its competence in the task of summarizing secientific documents. The PEGASUS-Large is a general-domain pre-trained model rather than a domain-specific one. The COVIDSum model, enhanced with SciBERT, shows high suitability for scientific summarization in the COVID-19 domain.Also, our proposed SciBERTbased COVIDSum model shows performance advantages over the general-domain BART for scientific summarization in the COVID-19 domain.Furthermore, to examine the significance of improvement, we conduct statistical hypothesis testing. Table 10 presents the results of the two-tailed paired t-test (with p < 0.05) comparing the COVIDSum with other abstractive summarization models including PGN + Cov, BERT-SumABS, HIBERT, and PEGASUS-Large. The Null hypothesis (H_0) is that the difference of means on ROUGE-2 F1 measure of two methods equals zero. Alternative hypothesis (H_1) is that the difference of means on ROUGE-2 F1 measure of two methods do not equal zero.As shown in Table 10 , the improvements on ROUGE-2 F1 score of our COVIDSum are statistically significant, compared to other neural abstractive approaches.Since it is difficult to determine whether each component in the COVIDSum contributes to the performance improvements, we compare our full model with three ablated variants. We conduct an ablation study by removing several modules while remaining the rest of the COVIDSum architecture unaltered. We report the following three typical ablation models:w/o (Graph Encoder & Feature Fusion): removing both the graph encoder and the feature fusion module, and the original COVIDSum degrades into a standard sequence-to-sequence model with a pre-trained encoder and a Transformer decoder; w/o Feature Fusion: removing feature fusion module and simply adding the features from two encoders together; w/o Pre-training: using a vanilla Transformer encoder without pre-training instead of the variant of a pre-trained BERT.From Table 11 , we observe that the overall performance on ROUGE metrics of COVIDSum model is rather comparative, but the ROUGE-2 score drops significantly when the pre-trained sequence encoder is substituted with a non-pre-trained one. This observation suggests that the pre-training process enables the Transformer encoder to capture the semantic features of input sequences, and further boosts the performance of COVIDSum. Compared to COVIDSum model, performance of the model w/o (Graph Encoder & Feature Fusion) declines dramatically. We deem that word co-occurrences are essential for summarization, and explicitly providing the word co-occurrence features contributes to the performance improvements of COVIDSum. Based on the results in the first, second and fourth rows, we can infer that both the graph encoder which incorporates word co-occurrence features, and the highway networks which fuses features can benefit the COVIDSum model and their contributions can be accumulated. Experimental results indicate that all features, techniques, and modules are effective for COVIDSum to achieve performance gains.The ROUGE metric only measures n-gram overlapping between the generated summary and the ground-truth summary. However, merely evaluating our method with ROUGE is not sufficient to prove its capability. To overcome this limitation, we also perform human expert evaluation with different summarization methods on CORD-19 dataset.We predefine four indicators to evaluate the quality of a generated summary: 1) Informativeness, which indicates how much the salient information of the source documents are remained; 2) Fluency, namely readability, means whether the generated text is grammatically correct and easy to understand; 3) Coherence, which evaluates the logicalness of paragraphs or sentences; 4) Redundancy, which measures the summary should contain few repeated information (higher score in the table indicates lower redundancy).Both the generated summaries and corresponding reference texts are required in our human evaluation settings. Thus, we did not evaluate the ground-truth summaries here, because they have already been used as reference texts to evaluate the generated summaries.']","The performance advantages of COVIDSum compared to other summarization models are statistically significant, as shown in Table 10. The factors that contribute to its improvements according to the results and evaluations are the incorporation of linguistic knowledge, word co-occurrence relationships, and the use of a pre-trained Transformer encoder.","The performance advantages of COVIDSum compared to other summarization models include outperforming other models on all four evaluation aspects: informativeness, fluency, coherence, and redundancy. The factors that contribute to its improvements are the use of pre-trained sequence encoders to capture semantic features, explicit linguistic knowledge such as word co-occurrence graphs, and the incorporation of highway networks for feature fusion. Additionally, the ability of COVIDSum to model sequences effectively and the effective combination of features, techniques, and modules contribute to its overall advantages.","What are the performance advantages of COVIDSum compared to other summarization models, and what factors contribute to its improvements according to the results and evaluations? ->: The performance advantages of COVIDSum compared to other summarization models include outperforming other models on all four evaluation aspects: informativeness, fluency, coherence, and redundancy.

COVIDSum has several performance advantages compared to other summarization models, including:

1. **Improved ROUGE scores**: COVIDSum achieved higher ROUGE scores than other models, indicating better performance in terms of fluency and coherence. This is likely due to the attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input text when generating the summary.

11,"What is the significance of the variations in the bond geometry-specific steric maps of Glu35 in the accessible (φ,ψ) space during molecular dynamics?","[' bond length and angle values on the accessible (φ,ψ) space while the protein is in motion. To illustrate this through an example, we chose Glu35 residue in the lysozyme structure, which is the active site residue. For each of the 50,000 snapshots from the unconstrained 1-fs timestep simulation, we generated the bond geometry-specific steric map for Glu35. Supplementary Video 1 shows the variations that occur in the bond geometry-specific steric maps of Glu35 during MD. The movie is a snippet of 1000 snapshots (frames 10, 000 to 11,000) out of the 50,000 snapshots. The corresponding dynamics of the dipeptide containing Glu35 is also shown on the right.Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https ://doi.org/10.1016/j.crstbi.2021.09.001The accessible (φ,ψ) space, as defined by steric-clash-free (φ,ψ) regions, is continuously changing, as shown in Supplementary Video 1. We note such variations in other proteins as well, as shown in Supplementary Videos 2-5. These correspond to the following residues of interest (residues in active site or evolutionarily conserved residues) in these proteins: Asn14 in Crambin (PDB code 3NIR) ( Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https ://doi.org/10.1016/j.crstbi.2021.09.001Some of the steric maps also look very different from the classic steric map derived by Ramachandran and co-workers based on the ideal dipeptide dimensions (Ramachandran et al., 1963) (shown in Supplementary Fig. 6(a) ). One such example is shown in Fig. 5(a) . This steric map corresponds to Glu35 of lysozyme at 10278 th femtosecond. There are significantly more (φ,ψ) values that are steric clash-free compared to the classical map. Interestingly, majority of the conformers with positive φ value are also steric clash-free. Also, several (φ,ψ) values close to φ ¼ 0 , which are usually disallowed due to severe clashes between carbonyl oxygen of i-1 residue and carbonyl carbon or carbonyl oxygen of ith residue, are now allowed. These clashes are avoided by subtle but acceptable adjustments to the backbone bond length and angle values Table 2 . As can be noted, all the bond lengths and angles concerned are within 5σ from ideal values, beyond which they are usually considered as outliers (Read et al., 2011) . The steric map may be viewed as a crude representation of van der Waals energy. In order to see how the map looks when energetic contributions from bonded interactions such as bond length and angle stretching, and also non-bonded interactions such as electrostatics and hydrogen bonding, are considered, we calculated the potential energy associated with every (φ,ψ) conformer of Glu35 at 10278 th femtosecond (see Materials and Methods for details on energy calculation). This energy map is shown in Fig. 5(b) . It can be seen that there is a good correspondence between the steric map and energy map. This shows that, apart from the van der Waals repulsion being minimal/absent in the steric clash-free regions of the steric map, the unfavorable energetic contributions from slightly deviant bond lengths and angles are not significant enough in majority of the (φ,ψ) regions.Another interesting phenomenon that can be seen in Supplementary Videos 1-5 is that some (φ,ψ) conformations which are disallowed due to steric clash at one time point say T1, becomes allowed (or) steric clashfree at a later time point, say T2. One such example is shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 (a) corresponds to steric map of Glu35 of lysozyme at 10065 th fs (say T1) from the unconstrained 1-fs timestep simulation. The (φ,ψ) value of Glu35 at this time point is (À69 ,-69 ) (shown as a green dot). This conformation is allowed at T1 as it is steric clash-free. At another timepoint T2 ¼ 21,121 fs, the (φ,ψ) value of Glu35 is (À103 ,-25 ). This Table 2 Backbone bond length and angles of Glu35 at time T ¼ 12,078 fs of 1-fs timestep unconstrained MD simulation along with ideal geometry parameters and Zscores. (φ,ψ) combination is disallowed at time']","The significance of the variations in the bond geometry-specific steric maps of Glu35 in the accessible (φ,ψ) space during molecular dynamics is that they show the continuously changing (φ,ψ) regions that are steric-clash-free. These variations indicate that the backbone bond length and angle values are adjusting to avoid clashes and allow for more conformations in the (φ,ψ) space.","The variations in the bond geometry-specific steric maps of Glu35 in the accessible (φ,ψ) space during molecular dynamics are significant because they demonstrate how subtle changes in backbone bond lengths and angles can affect the accessible conformational space of a protein. These variations show that the (φ,ψ) space is not static but continuously changing due to vibrational movements in the backbone bond geometry. This dynamic nature of the (φ,ψ) space allows for transitions in (φ,ψ) values within a residue, enabling the protein to sample regions that were originally considered inaccessible. By studying these variations, researchers can gain insights into how proteins can adjust their backbone geometry to explore different conformational states and overcome high-energy barriers in the conformational space.","What is the significance of the variations in the bond geometry-specific steric maps of Glu35 in the accessible (φ,ψ) space during molecular dynamics? ->: The variations in the bond geometry-specific steric maps of Glu35 in the accessible (φ,ψ) space during molecular dynamics are significant because they demonstrate how subtle changes in backbone bond lengths and angles can affect the accessible conformational space of a protein.

262,What are the pros and cons of using ferrets to study influenza compared to non-human primates?,"['] . The ferret model of influenza has remained the same since this fortuitous discovery, and, in the opinion of many researchers, the ferret remains the ideal small animal model for influenza research. Ferrets can be infected with non-adapted human influenza virus isolates. Influenza virus infection in ferrets is primarily an upper respiratory tract infection, and infected ferrets exhibit clinical signs of infection similar to those seen during human influenza including fever, rhinitis and sneezing. The disadvantages of the ferret as a model for studying influenza vaccines include expense, special housing requirements, a limited number of suppliers, difficulties in obtaining animals that are seronegative for influenza virus, their exquisite sensitivity to other respiratory pathogens and ease of acquiring infection from their handlers, and the lack of species-specific reagents, although this last point does not present an obstacle for the evaluation of HAI and neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, the high body temperature of ferrets (average temperature of 38.8 C) may limit their utility in the evaluation temperature-sensitive live attenuated influenza vaccines.Non-human primates have not been used extensively for influenza vaccine research. From a practical standpoint, these animals are expensive and they have not proven to be the best model for the study of vaccines for influenza. Old World and New World species of monkeys have been evaluated as models of human influenza infection. It was determined early in the days of the study of influenza virus biology that non-human primate species were not as susceptible to human influenza viruses as their human relatives. Burnet reported in 1941 [48] that clinical signs of infection were only apparent in cynomolgus macaques when they were infected via the intratracheal route as opposed to the intranasal route. Interestingly, mortality was observed in animals inoculated with the ""W.S. Egg"" strain, which was a mouseadapted human influenza virus that had been passaged in eggs. Burnet reported that pathological changes consistent with those seen in human influenza infection were observed in the lungs of infected monkeys. The observation that intratracheal infection in monkeys might be required to achieve clinical signs of infection was supported by studies conducted by Saslaw and colleagues [49] in Rhesus macaques. Intratracheal infection of Rhesus macaques with a lung filtrate from mice infected with mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus resulted in clinical signs of illness on day 2 post infection (p.i.), which resolved by day 4 p.i., whereas no signs of illness were apparent in monkeys inoculated with the same virus preparation intranasally, although both groups of animals showed hematological and serological evidence of infection.Cynomolgus macaques were explored as a model for the evaluation of the immunogenicity and efficacy of an immunostimulating complex (ISCOM) influenza vaccine by Rimmelzwaan and colleagues [50] . Cynomolgus macaques inoculated intratracheally with the human influenza A/Netherlands/18/94 (H3N2) virus did not develop clinical signs of illness but virus could be recovered from lung lavage, nasal swabs and pharyngeal swab samples. Histopathological examinations were not performed.Pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) were infected with a recombinant human influenza A/Texas/91 (H1N1) virus following virus administration via the trachea, tonsils and conjunctiva [51] . The animals exhibited clinical signs of infection, including loss of appetite, weight loss, nasal discharge and moderate fever, and histopathological observations that were consistent with progressive pneumonia. Virus was recovered from lung tissue at day 4 p.i. but not at day 7 p.i.New World monkeys -including squirrel and cebus monkeys -have been evaluated as models for influenza vaccine studies. Murphy et al. [52] demonstrated that adult squirrel monkeys could be infected with intratracheally administered human influenza viruses. Mild illness that manifested as afebrile coryza was seen and, although radiographic evidence of pneumonia was not observed, the animals shed virus from the respiratory tract. Further studies evaluated the ability of AI viruses to replicate and cause illness in this species [53] . Different viruses caused varying degrees of clinical illness; some influenza viruses were completely attenuated in squirrel monkeys, while others replicated efficiently and caused clinical signs which were of a severity similar to that seen in human H3N2 influenza infection. Squirrel monkeys were employed to evaluate the level of attenuation of avian/human influenza virus reassortants, in a study comparing the replication of reassortants in chimpanzees and human volunteers [54] ; the findings in squirrel monkeys were not predictive of the level of attenuation of the reassortant viruses in humans.Cebus apella and Cebus albifrons monkeys were evaluated as models for influenza infection by Grizzard et al']","The disadvantages of the ferret as a model for studying influenza vaccines include expense, special housing requirements, a limited number of suppliers, difficulties in obtaining animals that are seronegative for influenza virus, their exquisite sensitivity to other respiratory pathogens and ease of acquiring infection from their handlers, and the lack of species-specific reagents, although this last point does not present an obstacle for the evaluation of HAI and neutralizing antibody responses.","Pros of using ferrets to study influenza compared to non-human primates:

Evidence suggests that health care workers' infant feeding advice is undermined by implementing national guidelines within local contexts and fears of HIV transmission [36] . Aside from the nutritional superiority, the safety and immune benefits of breastmilk may need to be asserted to counter concerns during the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Support for breastfeeding cannot be distanced from support for the mother. Social protection policies such as the child support grant top-up and the COVID-19 social relief of distress grant in South Africa can assist women to reduce hunger while breastfeeding. In addition, mothers need reassurance about the quality of their breastmilk and their ability to breastfeed. Health care professionals and community health workers are trusted experts in this context and should be empowered to support breastfeeding mothers.This study sought to investigate whether recently improved breastfeeding rates [3] were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown-associated changes in economic and social circumstances and to assess the association between breastfeeding, maternal depressive symptoms, maternal hunger, and clinic visits. No association was found between breastfeeding practice and maternal depressive symptoms in this study.

27,How was the average precision used to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of the detection task?,"["" the fault diagnosis of the safetypins. To compare and benchmark the fault diagnosis, we chose the well-known VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) architecture. In both tasks, image augmentation was used to improve the generalization of the models. For object detection the brightness of the images was randomly adjusted. For the classification task, where cropped images of safetypins were classified, we applied horizontal and vertical flipping, random brightness adjustment, width as well as height range shifting, and random image blurring.The component detectors were implemented using the Tensorflow 3 DL framework 4 (Abadi et al. 2015) with models pretrained on the MS COCO dataset (Lin et al. 2014) . The image classifiers were realized using the Keras DL library 5 (Chollet et al. 2015) which provides image classification models pretrained on the ILSVRC dataset (Russakovsky et al. 2015) .For the evaluation of DF1-DF3 and DP1 and DP2 respectively, we conducted both an artificial evaluation to closely assess the pipeline's efficacy and efficiency as well as a naturalistic evaluation to generally judge the design's acceptance and usefulness. In accordance, the evaluation episodes were guided by the questions below: Artificial evaluation of the model component (EE I.I) The efficiency evaluation of the proposed pipelines required two considerations. First, the pipeline's ability to detect the chosen components needed to be evaluated. Second, the accuracy of the fault diagnosis -which we performed for detected safetypins -had to be assessed.Evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the detection task in terms of average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP) (Rafael Padilla and da Silva 2020), we compared our proposed MSCD to the SSCD pipeline. As we were working with our own proprietary dataset DS Ro , the available images were split into a training set comprising 80% of the data, with the remaining 20% used for the evaluation set. To increase the evaluation's validity, images captured at one tower were held out from the random split and solely utilized for the evaluation dataset, while maintaining the split ratio. This image-level split was kept consistent across the derived datasets DS1 Co and DS2 Fi . The SSCD pipeline was fine-tuned to detect the respective component classes using the DS Ro dataset. Accordingly, both detection stages of the MSCD pipeline were fine-tuned on DS1 Co and DS2 Fi respectively. All models were trained using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer with 0.0003 (Faster R-CNN) and 0.001 (SSD) initial learning rate respectively, 0.9 momentum, and batch size 64. We determined the models by using early stopping on the validation loss with a patience of 100 for all models. The testing results of the different pipelines using the different architectures are shown in Fig. 6 . The performance for the safetypin class is disclosed in terms of inter pipeline performance for both the SSCD and the MSCD pipeline as well as the intra pipeline performance for solely the MSCD pipeline.We evaluated the fault diagnosis task performed for the safetypins class in terms of weighted precision, weighted recall, and weighted F 1 -score (Pedregosa et al. 2011) to account for class imbalance. We applied a 3-fold cross validated grid-search to identify the optimal combination of parameters. We chose to account for the following parameter: unfrozen convolutional layers, dense layer size, optimizer and its respective learning rate, dropout rate, and batch size. The images in dataset DS3 Pi were shuffled, a hold out set containing 10% of the images was retained and the remaining images were split into 3 folds. Consequently, for each grid search configuration three models were trained with early stopping with patience 30. The best resulting model of the Resnet and VGG16 model were harnessed to be evaluated on the retained hold out set. The results of the evaluation of the cropped safetypin classification task based on the test set are shown in Table 6 . All details on the machine learning steps and choices are depicted within Sect. A2 in the Appendix (Kühl et al. 2021) .Naturalistic evaluation of the model component (EE I.II)To answer whether the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs help MEs, we conducted nine purposefully sampled (Coyne 1997) interviews with potential users of the IB-DSS from our case company.

The average precision was used to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of the detection task by calculating the average precision of the detections made by the model. The average precision is a measure of the average proportion of true positive detections among all detections made by the model. It is calculated as the average of the precision values obtained from the detections made by the model.

As shown in Figure 6 (i), IL-1β strongly enhanced the adhesion of A549 cells to the PMC monolayer, while IL-1RA abrogated the adhesion capability. As indicated in the Western blot results in Figure 6 (j), IL-1β increased the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, whereas it had no effect on E-cadherin. IL-1RA had the opposite effect on EMT markers compared with IL-1β.In previous studies, we reported that the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a could enhance the homing of nonclassical monocytes to the pleural cavity by the chemokine axis in The protein levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin were detected by Western blot (n = 3). *Versus. control group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. # Versus C5a group, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01. & Versus C5aRA group, & p < 0.05, && p < 0.01 tuberculosis pleural effusion (TPE). 21 In the present study, we extended our previous work and demonstrated that the activation of C5a in MPE induced the recruitment of intermediate monocytes and played an essential role in the progression of MPE.In the context of cancer, complement C3a and C5a, which leads to tumor-promoting chronic inflammation in the majority of the studied mouse models, are continually generated. 23 However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of the complement system, especially C3a and C5a, in MPE remain unknown. In the present study, we observed activation of the classical and alternative pathways, while little presence of the MBL pathway in malignant pleurisy tissue (Figure 2) , which is different from tuberculous pleurisy. 21 Li et al. elucidated an unknown feature of MBL function in suppressing tumor development. 24 Consistent with their results, we also detected no MBL expression in MPE, indicating that in advanced tumors, low or even no MBL expression is favorable to tumor development and promotes tumor growth. Considering the differential activation of the complement pathway in MPE and TPE, the expressions of complement factors in pleural effusion might be a promising diagnostic marker. In the present study, we detected high activation of C5a and low levels of C3a, both by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Our data were consistent with those reported by Bulla and colleagues, 15 which revealed a strong signal for C1q in lung adenocarcinoma and mild expression of C3. Thus, the activation of the classical and alternative pathways is increased in MPE and may be responsible for the high level of C5a. Because C5a is a strong chemoattractant for inflammatory cells, the major focus of this study was to explore the role of C5a and monocytes in MPE progression.Emerging evidence indicates that monocytes contribute to carcinogenesis by releasing inflammatory mediators. 25 Wang et al. reported that the CD163 + CD14 + and CD206 + CD14 + cell frequencies in MPE were markedly higher than those in benign pleural effusion, and these CD14 positive cells could potentially be used as an immune diagnostic marker for MPE. 26, 27 However, the authors did not analyze the subtype of monocytes in MPE. In agreement with Wang et al. our data also revealed that the portion of monocytes was higher in MPE, showing significant increases compared to those in the blood (Figure 1(a),(b) ). In addition, we demonstrated that CD14 ++ CD16 À classical monocytes were decreased in malignant pleurisy patients, while CD14 + CD16 + nonclassical and CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes were significantly increased in MPE, which was different from the observations in TPE. 21 Interestingly, the proportion of CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes in MPE was 12 times higher than that in peripheral blood (Figure 1(c) , (d)). However, it is unclear how these accumulating intermediate monocytes enter the pleural cavity and whether they promote the progression of MPE.Monocytes were found to be recruited by complement C5a through the increased secretion of chemokines, including CCL2, in severe COVID-19 patients. 28 Our previous results also demonstrated that C5a mediated the infiltration of monocytes into the pleural cavity by inducing the expression of chemokines (CCL2, CCL7 and CX3CL1) released by PMCs in TPE. 21 These studies indicated that C5a was a strong chemoattractant for monocytes.

4,What is the appearance of the classic steric map derived by Ramachandran and co-workers based on the ideal dipeptide dimensions?,"[' bond length and angle values on the accessible (φ,ψ) space while the protein is in motion. To illustrate this through an example, we chose Glu35 residue in the lysozyme structure, which is the active site residue. For each of the 50,000 snapshots from the unconstrained 1-fs timestep simulation, we generated the bond geometry-specific steric map for Glu35. Supplementary Video 1 shows the variations that occur in the bond geometry-specific steric maps of Glu35 during MD. The movie is a snippet of 1000 snapshots (frames 10, 000 to 11,000) out of the 50,000 snapshots. The corresponding dynamics of the dipeptide containing Glu35 is also shown on the right.Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https ://doi.org/10.1016/j.crstbi.2021.09.001The accessible (φ,ψ) space, as defined by steric-clash-free (φ,ψ) regions, is continuously changing, as shown in Supplementary Video 1. We note such variations in other proteins as well, as shown in Supplementary Videos 2-5. These correspond to the following residues of interest (residues in active site or evolutionarily conserved residues) in these proteins: Asn14 in Crambin (PDB code 3NIR) ( Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https ://doi.org/10.1016/j.crstbi.2021.09.001Some of the steric maps also look very different from the classic steric map derived by Ramachandran and co-workers based on the ideal dipeptide dimensions (Ramachandran et al., 1963) (shown in Supplementary Fig. 6(a) ). One such example is shown in Fig. 5(a) . This steric map corresponds to Glu35 of lysozyme at 10278 th femtosecond. There are significantly more (φ,ψ) values that are steric clash-free compared to the classical map. Interestingly, majority of the conformers with positive φ value are also steric clash-free. Also, several (φ,ψ) values close to φ ¼ 0 , which are usually disallowed due to severe clashes between carbonyl oxygen of i-1 residue and carbonyl carbon or carbonyl oxygen of ith residue, are now allowed. These clashes are avoided by subtle but acceptable adjustments to the backbone bond length and angle values Table 2 . As can be noted, all the bond lengths and angles concerned are within 5σ from ideal values, beyond which they are usually considered as outliers (Read et al., 2011) . The steric map may be viewed as a crude representation of van der Waals energy. In order to see how the map looks when energetic contributions from bonded interactions such as bond length and angle stretching, and also non-bonded interactions such as electrostatics and hydrogen bonding, are considered, we calculated the potential energy associated with every (φ,ψ) conformer of Glu35 at 10278 th femtosecond (see Materials and Methods for details on energy calculation). This energy map is shown in Fig. 5(b) . It can be seen that there is a good correspondence between the steric map and energy map. This shows that, apart from the van der Waals repulsion being minimal/absent in the steric clash-free regions of the steric map, the unfavorable energetic contributions from slightly deviant bond lengths and angles are not significant enough in majority of the (φ,ψ) regions.Another interesting phenomenon that can be seen in Supplementary Videos 1-5 is that some (φ,ψ) conformations which are disallowed due to steric clash at one time point say T1, becomes allowed (or) steric clashfree at a later time point, say T2. One such example is shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 (a) corresponds to steric map of Glu35 of lysozyme at 10065 th fs (say T1) from the unconstrained 1-fs timestep simulation. The (φ,ψ) value of Glu35 at this time point is (À69 ,-69 ) (shown as a green dot). This conformation is allowed at T1 as it is steric clash-free. At another timepoint T2 ¼ 21,121 fs, the (φ,ψ) value of Glu35 is (À103 ,-25 ).

As shown in Figure 4 (d), ELISA detection of monocyte culture supernatant showed a similar result. Our findings indicated that C5a enhanced IL-1β release from CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes in MPE C5a plays a role in the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of lung cancer cellsTo investigate the role of C5a in the progression of MPE, we first evaluated the effects of C5a on the proliferation of A549 cells. As indicated by Ki-67 expression levels and the CCK-8 assay, C5a subsantially promoted A549 cell proliferation, while C5aRA suppressed it ( Figure 5(a),(b) ). By western blot, we further found that C5a caused a significant increase in the levels of p-AKT and PI3K expression, and this effect could be inhibited by C5aRA (Figure 5(c) ). The PI3K inhibitor LY29f4002 resulted in a decrease in Ki-67-positive A549 cells and a lower proliferation index than C5a treatment alone ( Figure 5(d) ,(e)).As flow cytometry and Western blot results indicated, neither C5a nor C5aRA exerted a significant effect on the Figure 5 (h),(i), the apoptosis of A549 cells and the protein levels of cleaved-Caspase 3 and Bax were significantly decreased in the C5a + DDP group, while they were elevated in the C5aRA + DDP group, and C5a could reverse the increase in apoptosis caused by C5aRA.We then sought to investigate whether C5a was involved in the regulation of tumor cell migration and invasion. As soon as 24 h after wounding, C5a showed promoting effects on A549 wound closure ( Figure 5(j) ). Unexpectedly, incubation with C5aRA alone had no effects on A549 migration, while it was harmful to C5a-enhanced A549 cell wound healing ( Figure 5(j) ). As expected, the addition of C5a strongly promoted tumor invasion activity. Although the addition of C5aRA alone did not affect this invasion activity, it significantly suppressed the invasion activity increased by C5a (Figure 5(k) ).The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) was significantly elevated after C5a treatment, which could be abolished by the addition of C5aRA ( Figure 5(l) ). An adhesion assay further confirmed that a significant number of A549 cells adhered to the PMC monolayer within 24 h. As expected, C5a strongly enhanced adhesion, while C5aRA abrogated the enhanced adhesion activity of tumor cells and PMCs ( Figure 5(m) ). Moreover, Western blot results demonstrated that the levels of N-cadherin and vimentin, markers of mesenchymal cells, were significantly increased in C5a-treated A549 cells, whereas the expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial cell marker, was severely decreased. Our results also indicated that C5aRA had the opposite effect on EMT in A549 cells as C5a (Figure 5(n) ).As shown in Figure 6(a),(b) , Ki-67 expression and the proliferation index of A549 cells were increased in the presence of IL-1β, and this effect was dramatically inhibited by the IL-1R antagonist (IL-1RA). The MAPK pathway is the bestknown signaling pathway in the development of cancer and regulates important cellular processes such as proliferation. We then assessed the protein levels of MAPK and p-MAPK in treated A549 cells and found that IL-1β treatment resulted in a significant increase in the levels of MAPK and (Figure 6(c) ). Our data showed that apoptosis was significantly lower in IL-1β-treated cells than in untreated control cells, while the IL-1β receptor antagonist significantly stimulated the apoptosis of A549 cells (Figure 6(d) ,(e)).As the wound-healing assay showed, there was a significant decline in A549 migration in the IL-1RA group compared to the control group after 36 h (Figure 6(f) ). As the transwell assay showed, in the presence of IL-1β, tumor invasion activity was promoted, while the addition of IL-1RA significantly prevented the increase in invasion capability caused by IL-1β (Figure 6(g) ).In addition, IL-1β significantly induced ICAM-1 expression in lung cancer cells, and this effect was abolished by the addition of IL-1']","C5a promotes A549 cell proliferation and IL-1β expression, while C5aRA suppresses A549 cell proliferation and IL-1β expression.","The relationship between C5a and A549 cell proliferation is that C5a can enhance the proliferation of A549 cells.

C5a has been shown to promote A549 cell proliferation and IL-1β expression through the activation of Gαi/o-coupled receptors. The activation of these receptors leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and the subsequent decrease in cAMP levels, which in turn inhibits the expression of IL-1β.

32,How has the COVID-19 pandemic placed stress on healthcare systems worldwide?,"['Nudging healthcare professionals to improve treatment of COVID-19: a narrative review\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on healthcare systems worldwide and disrupted routine care. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) have had to quickly improvise and adapt to cope with a novel deadly virus with uncertain treatment options, lack of evidence, and a shortage of medical supply and personal protective equipment.In an ideal world, clinicians would base their decisions on scientific evidence and best practices. In practice, however, behavioural science shows that decisions are affected by emotional and cognitive biases, especially under stress. 1 2 Understanding the behavioural nature of decision-making is essential for designing processes that mitigate risks and improve the quality of care. This is particularly important because of the fast-paced developments characterising the COVID-19 pandemic.One effective strategy in improving decision-making is nudging: subtle changes to the design of the environment or framing choices without restrictions to encourage a given behaviour. 3 These strategies are often easy to scale and implement at a low cost, making nudging a practical approach to behaviour change. 4 Nudging interventions have been widely effective, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] but often patient directed, and less attention has been given to the use of behavioural insights to support HCPs in making appropriate medical decisions.In this review, we synthesise the available literature on how nudging techniques can be used to affect the behaviour of HCPs in clinical settings in order to see if these can be useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The results are intended to guide and inspire quick implementation of cost-effective solutions that can improve the quality of care.Our objective was to identify interventions using nudge theory 3 to affect the behaviour of HCPs in clinical settings, focusing on target groups, nudging techniques, delivery systems and empirical evidence.Open access intervention, including purpose, target behaviour, measured outcomes, key findings, nudging strategies used and their theoretical underpinnings. The characteristics of the nudging strategies that would allow for systematic grouping were identified. Several grouping approaches were discussed until the most appropriate grouping was selected. The studies were categorised and characterised using descriptive analysis.Nudging is often referenced to two modes of thinking: the automatic system (system 1) and the reflective system (system 2). 3 17 However, the underlying behavioural strategies that give rise to different interventions are not always described or easy to characterise. Therefore, we categorised the nudging strategies according to two practical dimensions: ► Synchronous versus asynchronous: an intervention strategy is synchronous if its delivery coincides with the decision or behaviour it intends to affect, while an asynchronous strategy can be performed anytime. For example, providing alternative options when a clinician is prescribing antibiotics in the electronic system is a synchronous strategy: alternative options (nudge) are presented when the prescription (target behaviour) is taking place. A poster providing information on sound antibiotic prescribing is an asynchronous strategy not connected to a specific prescription. ► Active versus passive: an active strategy cannot be completed without action from the targeted clinician, while a passive strategy does not require any action. For example, requesting written justifications for an antibiotic prescription to complete the order is active strategy: the prescription (target behaviour) cannot be completed without justification (nudge), while changing the default prescription is a passive strategy.The database search yielded 1436 articles (figure 1); 36 duplicates and additional 1352 articles that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria were excluded. Of the 48 articles included for full-text review, 28 were excluded because they were not relevant to COVID-19, resulting in 20 articles included in the analysis. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and five focused on encouraging judicious antibiotic prescription. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Out of the 20 studies included for analysis, seven employed more than one medium of intervention, and 13 employed only one. While seven studies delivered the intervention via electronic health records (EHRs) or electronic prescription ordering systems, nine used communication technologies such as email, text messages or traditional letters. Six studies altered the physical environment by using posters, lights or aromatisation, two made modifications to the ventilation machines and two introduced electronic dashboards. Seventeen of the 20 articles had a statistically significant positive result (online supplemental table S1). Of the three that failed, two 24 29 delivered the nudge through email and one through letter. 30 Overall, 28 different nudging strategies were identified, including accountable justifications, active choices, alerts and reminders, default settings, environmental cueing, feedback, peer comparison, goal setting, information transparency, suggested alternatives and education (online supplemental table S1). There was no standard nomenclature across articles, and many of the articles did not discuss the underlying behavioural theories that gave rise to the nudging intervention.The authors']",The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on healthcare systems worldwide.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant stress on healthcare systems worldwide.

158,What is the proposed relationship between electrophysiological recordings and brain activity coordination across spatial scales?,"[' increase in alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is frequently observed in electrophysiological recordings. 36, 37 Alpha-gamma PAC dynamically coordinates brain activity over multiple spatial scales, 73, 74 such that gamma oscillations within local neuronal ensembles are coupled with large-scale patterns of low-frequency phase synchrony. 75 It is proposed that such dynamics allow information to be routed efficiently between brain areas and for neuronal representations to be segmented and maintained, e.g., during visual working memory. 76, 77 Following the presentation of a visual grating, we found that in VSS, alpha-gamma PAC in V1 was reduced compared to controls. This reduction occurred despite the VSS group displaying stronger visual gamma power in primary visual cortex. Interestingly, disruptions to PAC have also been reported in tinnitus, 78 although increased PAC has also been shown. 79 Our findings suggest that visual activity in VSS is both hyperexcitable (increased gamma power) and disorganised (reduced alpha-gamma PAC). Both results could be underpinned by an excitation-inhibition imbalance in visual cortex, as the neurophysiological generation of gamma amplitude and PAC relies heavily on local inhibitory populations of neurons. 80 Affected local inhibitory processes would produce high-frequency \'noisy\' activity and reduced signal-to-noise in perceptual systems, similar to findings reported in tinnitus. 16, 81 However, further corroborating evidence will be required before a definitive link between VSS, E-I interactions, and PAC can be confirmed. Disorganised local activity could also have concomitant effects on establishing inter-regional and global connectivity. 82 Where top-down mechanisms are affected in VSS, altered noise-cancelling (i.e., the ""gain"") of perceptual systems might result, 83, 84 meaning that typical visual stimuli would produce noisy and hyperactive responses in visual cortex, irrespective of their context. 1 Reduced noise cancelling could explain previous EEG findings of reduced habituation in VSS. 14 Future studies, specifically targeting perceptual gain and visual feedback pathways, 29, 85 should explore these ideas in more detail.From a clinical perspective, our novel findings of increased gamma power and reduced alpha-gamma PAC in VSS suggest that interventions targeting the re-establishment of typical rhythmical activity may help manage and treat the condition. Subject-specific neuromodulation approaches like repetitive TMS and cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation, 86 or neurofeedback approaches targeting gamma power and/or alphagamma PAC could be used for managing VS symptoms. 87, 88 Previous research has employed a range of imaging modalities to identify surrogate markers of brain dysfunction in VSS 89 . For example, using 18 Resting-state functional MRI data from a VSS cohort also showed hyperconnectivity between extrastriate and inferior temporal regions and between prefrontal and parietal cortex. 12 Research utilising structural and functional MRI has reported disruptions to a wide array of brain regions in VSS. For example, increases in grey matter volume are found in lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus junction, primary and secondary visual cortices, middle and superior temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. 6, 8, 12 Using functional MRI with a visual paradigm, Puledda and colleagues report decreased BOLD responses in VSS specific for the insula, which were interpreted as disruptions to the salience network. 6 Overall, regions overlapping with extrastriate visual cortex seem to be most commonly associated with VSS. 6, 8, 12, 89 These regions are responsible for high-level visual processing such as colour vision perception and are linked with palinopsia 2 : a symptom that was present in 94% of our cohort. Our data extend this work by showing how functional changes in VSS are present even earlier in the visual hierarchy (i.e., primary visual cortex). These low-level alterations might then propagate downstream to extrastriate regions and beyond.Finally, electrophysiological markers of VSS have reported a number of low-level differences versus controls, including increased N145 latency, 13 and reduced habituation. 14, 93 Our results build on this research by demonstrating differences in the endogenous rhythms of the brain during visual processing. Findings of reduced habituation in VSS are particularly interesting, as they suggest a disrupted noise-cancellation mechanism, which is unable to modulate hyperactive and noisy V1 activity.While this study has focussed on dysrhythmias measured from the cortex, it is also essential to consider other brain regions, such as the thalamus. Work over the last few decades suggests that the thalamus does not simply act as a relay station during sensory processing.Instead, there exists a robust network of cortico-thalamic feedback neurons that dynamically influence sensory processing. 94 One prominent theoretical account termed ""thalamocortical dysrhythmia"" (TCD) suggests that']",Alpha-gamma PAC dynamically coordinates brain activity over multiple spatial scales.,"The proposed relationship between electrophysiological recordings and brain activity coordination across spatial scales involves alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). This dynamic coordination allows for efficient routing of information between brain areas and the segmentation and maintenance of neuronal representations, especially during tasks like visual working memory. Alpha-gamma PAC is suggested to coordinate brain activity by coupling gamma oscillations within local neuronal ensembles with large-scale patterns of low-frequency phase synchrony. This coordination facilitates effective inter-regional communication during sensory processing and helps to maintain neural activity in a coherent manner.","What is the proposed relationship between electrophysiological recordings and brain activity coordination across spatial scales? ->: The proposed relationship between electrophysiological recordings and brain activity coordination across spatial scales involves alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC).

More PD patients tended to self report adherence to cough etiquette and hand hygiene than HD patients, although the difference between the two was not statistically significant. Of PD patients, 45.7% answered ""very likely"" to the question about whether they covered their mouths when coughing and sneezing, whereas only 29.5% of HD patients did so (p = 0.757). Regarding hand hygiene, 26.9% of PD patients and 13.5% of HD patients answered ""very likely"" about washing hands (p = 0.166). There was no significant difference patients in the habit of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks) during meals between HD and PD patients. The average time staying at In this study, we investigated COVID-19-related psychological stress experienced by dialysis patients and the difference in concerns between HD and PD patients. First, dialysis patients had relatively high psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Second, HD patients showed higher psychological distress and concerns related to COVID-19 than PD patients. Third, various concerns and precautionary measures for COVID-19 were associated with the psychological distress of HD and PD patients. In a previous study that meta-analyzed factors associated with psychological distress, pre-existing physical conditions with higher COVID-19 infection risk were associated with higher anxiety and depression [22] , consistent with results of the present study showing a high degree of anxiety and depression symptoms and psychological distress in dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Sources of distress might include feelings of vulnerability or the loss of control and concerns about one\'s health and the spread of the virus [23] . The fact that COVID-19 is transmitted humanto-human and that it is associated with high morbidity might intensify the perception of personal health problems, especially for patients with chronic illnesses [24, 25] . However, due to the sudden occurrence of this outbreak, we were unable to assess an individual\'s psychological condition before the outbreak. Since there were no data before COVID-19, it was difficult to conclude that the more pronounced psychological distress of HD patients was only due to COVID-19. Interestingly, a recent study in the Netherlands [26] investigating the mental health of dialysis patients (on HD, PD, and home hemodialysis [HHD]) during COVID-19 and compared with the period preceding the pandemic has reported the mental health of dialysis patients is unaffected by the pandemic. To overcome this limitation, we included concerns and precautionary measures taken for COVID-19 and showed their associations with the psychological distress of patients. We also tried to identify the difference between HD and PD patients. They decided their dialysis modalities with balanced information. As a result, they have a unique medical behavior. Thus, it is worth to investigate how dialysis modalities work in the COVID-19 era. According to our study, the psychological distress of COVID-19 was more pronounced in HD patients than in PD patients. Interestingly, in our regression analysis, HD patients had lower level of confidence. This can be related to the severity of their depressive and anxiety symptoms. The nature of patients undergoing HD being highly dependent on the hospitals and doctors might have an impact on the above results. Regarding concerns about COVID-19, more than half of both HD and PD patients felt there was too much unnecessary worry about COVID-19. Chronic disease patients experienced psychological distress more than the general population in previous studies [22, 27] , similar to our results. In addition, compared to PD patients, more HD patients responded that they felt less likely to be exposed to the virus. However, only a few of them answered that they would survive if infected with COVID-19. These results suggest that HD patients might have cognitive bias related to risk perception and more emotional impact than PD patients. Cognitive biases are associated with psychopathology. They may alter threat perception, while risk perception is strongly associated with the emotional impact of the threat itself [28] . In terms of precautionary measures, PD patients maintained cough etiquette better with']",Wearing masks is associated with psychological distress in HD and PD patients during COVID-19.,"The study showed that wearing masks was associated with psychological distress in both HD and PD patients during COVID-19. PD patients had better compliance with wearing masks compared to HD patients. More PD patients were likely to wear masks, while a small percentage of HD patients were less likely to wear masks. This difference in mask-wearing behavior between the two groups may have contributed to varying levels of psychological distress experienced by HD and PD patients during the pandemic.","How does wearing masks affect psychological distress in HD and PD patients during COVID-19? ->: The study showed that wearing masks was associated with psychological distress in both HD and PD patients during COVID-19.

138,What are the characteristics of type I inhibitors and their relation to COVID-19 patient improvement?,"[' toxic effects due to blocking JAK2 for red blood cell and platelet formation will be less severe.The industry identified several small molecule ATP competitors with nM affinity to each of the JAKs, or to several JAKs. Two molecules are mainly under focus of this review, baricitinib and ruxolitinib. Baricitinib exhibits an IC50 under 10 nM JAK1 and JAK2 (4.0-5.9 nM for JAK1 and 6.6-8.8 nM for JAK2), 787 nM for JAK3 and 61 nM TYK2, all determined at 1 mM ATP. 87 These values are different as a function of the amount of ATP used and may also depend on the technique to assay inhibition of kinase activity. [87] [88] [89] Ruxolitinib exhibits also IC50s of less than 10 nM for JAK1 and JAK2, specifically IC50 3.3-6.4 nM for JAK1, 2.8-8.8 nM for JAK2, 428-487 nM for JAK3 and approximately 10-fold selectivity for TYK2 (IC50 19-30 nM). [87] [88] [89] They are both type I inhibitors with rather low halflife, 4 hours for ruxolitinib and 12.5 hours for baricitinib. In addition, we will discuss tofacitinib (JAK1 and JAK3 inhibitor), upadacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor) and nezulcitinib (pan JAKi, inhaled). We will not discuss the strictly JAK1 specific filgotinib, as its clinical development is most recent. Also, a JAK2 inhibitor, fedratinib which was only recently approved in the clinics after a pause in development, will not be discussed. However, it appears that although all their differences a JAKi class effect is emerging, with potential relevance in COVID-19.Structural bases for inhibitor action. The first crystal structure of ruxolitinib was solved in complex with the kinase domain of c-Src, 90 while the structure of the JAK2 Open access kinase domain was solved in complex with a pan JAKi. 91 The X-ray crystal structure of baricitinib was initially solved in complex with a member of the Numb-associated kinases, namely BMP2-inducible kinase. 92 Only in 2021, in a very recent study which is being published in Blood the structures of ruxolitinib and of baricitinib were reported with the JAK2 kinase domain. 93 Of great interest, these structures allowed the first examination of ruxolitinib and baricitinib engaged with their main target (figure 2B). It also afforded design of ruxolitinib and baricitinib modified molecules where a linker was introduced to a solvent exposed carbon (C2 of the pyrimidine ring) of each inhibitor to which pomalidomide or thalidomide were linked. Proteolysis-targeting compounds were created and showed that they hold the potential to degrade JAK2 in target cells. 93 JAKi has known a broadening use in the clinics over the past decade and new molecules keep being designed. 94 Ruxolitinib, one of the oldest JAKi, is the agent most used in hematology patients whereas other JAKi such as baricitinib and tofacitinib are used more commonly in systemic rheumatic diseases (tofacitinib for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ulcerative colitis and baricitinib for patients with rheumatoid arthritis).There is extensive literature on the effects of JAKi in MPNs (in MF and complicated PV). In these conditions, the treatment is effective for alleviating symptoms, improving quality of life, overall survival, decreasing spleen size, but is not curative, as allele burdens do not significantly decrease. Most importantly, resistance to treatment exists, that is not linked to further mutations in the driver JAK2 gene. This is very different from the situation with imatinib and BCR/ABL1 driven chronic myeloid leukemia where mutations in ABL kinase domain, the main target, are explaining resistance. 95 These results have been interpreted to suggest that the targets of JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib are non-mutated JAK1 and JAK2 in inflammatory cells, suggesting that JAKi may act as effective anti-inflammatory agents in MPNs, 96 which is indeed the goal of their use in systemic rheumatic diseases or in newer indications such as or HLH 80 or graft-versushost disease (GVHd). [97] [98]', ' clinical improvement in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.The same overall conclusions were reported by a metaanalysis, 161 which examined two databases for RCTs in hospitalized patients, where patients were assigned to JAKi or standard of care. Pooling data from 4 such trials with 1338 subjects and treatment with either baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib and nezulcitinib. Treatment with a JAKi led to a significant reduction in the risk of COVID-19 death by 43%. 161 Although these meta-analyses provide a positive image on the efficacy of JAKi in COVID-19, there are several weaknesses. There is redundancy in the studies interrogated. Head-to-head comparisons of different inhibitors in similar settings was not performed. In addition, lack of systematic information on the timing of start of treatment and the variability of simultaneous glucocorticoid treatment further complicate interpretation.There are known adverse effects of the JAKi, which have been described in phase 3 clinical trials with ruxolitinib in MF and PV and then observed for other JAK2 inhibitors. [162] [163] [164] Given that JAK2 is essential for formation of red blood cells and platelets, anemia and thrombocytopenia can be induced by the use of JAK2 inhibitors. [162] [163] [164] In addition, given the involvement of JAKs in the immune response especially via IFNγ, reactivation of latent herpes simplex, zona-zoster, hepatitis B infections and tuberculosis are well known potential adverse effects. Several patients treated for MPNs with ruxolitinib developed aggressive B cell lymphomas. 165 Given that the timeframe of administration of JAKi is rather short (less than 30 days) in COVID-19 the expectation is that the effects reported after long-term use will not be detected.Several JAKi are being investigated for potential thrombotic risk. 166 This is apparently the case for tofacitinib and upacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor). 166 This issue is of great relevance given the thrombotic risk of COVID-19. Also, baricitinib should be examined for potential thrombotic risk. 167 In September 2021, FDA issued an updated warning about increased risk of serious heart-related events, cancer, bloot clots and death for JAKi that treat certain chronic inflammatory conditions. 168 This warning is based on a review of a large randomized safety clinical trial involving tofacitinib, but the warning has been extended to other JAKi treating such chronic inflammatory condition, such as baricitinib and upacitinib. This warning may not be relevant for treatment with JAKi in COVID-19 due to the short treatment duration, while the safety trial concerned chronic longer exposure to JAKi.A couple of potential adverse effects of JAKi including cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, as well as toxicity of combinations including JAKi have been reviewed in. 169 The coadministration, of either baricitinib or ruxolitinib, along with IL-6 inhibitors (eg, tocilizumab, siltuximab) could produce additive immunosuppression with possible severe bacterial or fungal infections. Ruxolitinib inhibits colchicine metabolism and this is relevant in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Favipiravir may enhance baricitinib exposure. In contrast, no adverse effects have been reported for simultaneous use of JAKi and remdesivir or dexamethasone.Although the pandemic situation seems to wear-off in western countries and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have led to limiting hospitalisations, predicting the future evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human population is difficult. Many questions remain concerning new outbreaks, evolution of the virus or how long protection following natural infection or vaccination will last. Therefore, the potential for drugs to treat people suffering from COVID-19 remains of interest.The major targets for inhibition in COVID-19 are the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunopathological phenomena triggered by the delayed cytokine storm inducing lung pathology and ARDS. Since cytokines act via JAKs, JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitors may emerge as potential useful therapeutic tools in the COVID-19 pathology. A JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib also inhibits the Numb Associated Kinase AAK1, which is involved in endocytosis of the virus. Hence baricitinib would act both via inhibiting the immunopathology and inflammation due to JAK1/JAK2 inhibition, but also via direct inhibition of virus entry and assembly due to AAK1 inhibition.

Studies have shown that the use of JAK inhibitors like baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and nezulcitinib, in combination with standard care, can lead to a reduced risk of mortality and clinical improvement in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. JAK inhibitors, particularly baricitinib, have been recommended by the WHO for severe COVID-19 treatment due to their potential benefits in reducing major outcomes in patients with COVID-19. However, it is important to note that more robust clinical confirmation is still needed, and the timing of JAK inhibitor treatment in COVID-19 patients is crucial to ensure the best outcomes.","What are the characteristics of type I inhibitors and their relation to COVID-19 patient improvement? ->: Type I inhibitors, specifically JAK inhibitors, are known to exert immunosuppressive effects that can help cut off pathological reactions in COVID-19.

62,What is the potential impact of mutations on the effectiveness of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2?,"['] . Although the frequencies of these mutations are low, and none has been found to be enriched in the current pandemic, these highlight that such mutations can potentially diminish or abolish the effectiveness of the currently available and in-developmentantibodies [66, 87] . Because spontaneously arising mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains can be positively selected, and ultimately become the dominant strain to achieve viral escape under pressure from a neutralizing antibody [88] [89] [90] [91] , strategies have been developed to protect against this. One strategy is to design broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the RBD because these are less likely to mutate [92] [93] [94] . Another method to combat potential escape mutants is to use a combination of several neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies in cocktails would target distinct epitopes, enabling an additive effect in potency. Indeed, such strategies have been employed for earlier outbreaks, as seen in Ebola (REGN-EB3) and SARS-CoV-1 (antibody cocktail of CR3014 and CR3022) [66] . These previous successes spurred Regeneron to start the development of a dual antibody cocktail for COVID-19 (REGN-COV2, a combination of two antibodies, REGN10933 + REGN10987; Table 1 ) [88, 89] . AstraZeneca has also confirmed a pair of mAbs (AZD8895 + AZD1061) that will be taken forward as a combination therapy, known as AZD7442, into clinical development (Table 1 ). It is anticipated that this cocktail strategy may be crucial in increasing the potency of antibodies for use against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutating strains.Antibodies represent a double-edged sword in that they can both neutralize and enhance viral infection [95] : highly potent neutralizing antibodies can recognize specific viral epitopes and block viral entry to the host cells, whereas poorly neutralizing antibodies can promote infection through a phenomenon known as ADE. ADE is seen in responses to many infectious diseases including dengue fever, in which the natural progression of the disease has been shown to utilize antibodies from the primary response to infection as a basis for increased severity in later secondary infections [96] . Similarly, poorly neutralizing antibodies or antibodies with low affinity can promote virus entry upon secondary infection, resulting in increased viral burden and more severe disease progression via ADE (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] . Mechanisms of ADE largely rely on the uptake of virus-antibody immune complexes into host immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes, a process that is mediated through interactions between the Fc domain on the antibodies and Fc receptor (FcR) on host cells. These virus-antibody immune complexes in turn initiate different downstream proinflammatory signaling pathways, leading to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased viral load (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] .ADE has previously been observed for antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 [100] [101] [102] . Upon rechallenge in SARS-CoV-1-vaccinated rhesus macaques, passive transfer of anti-spike IgG correlated with disease progression, as observed by the presence of severe diffuse alveolar damage and loss of disease tolerance [103, 104] . It was observed that the same antisera against SARS-CoV-1 may confer neutralization or enhancement based solely on the concentrations of the antisera employed where enhancement and neutralization occur at lower and higher concentrations, respectively [102] . Thus, a threshold dependent on both antibody concentration and affinity may need to be considered in aiming to confer neutralization instead of enhancement [103] .Convalescent plasma therapy for infectious diseases is also known to be more effective as a prophylactic if administered shortly after symptoms arise when viral titers are thought to be lower [31, 105, 106] , suggesting that the threshold of viral load is also an important factor to consider. Although to date (as of 28 July 2020) there have been no observations of ADE in antibodies currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 [107] , in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as two early clinical studies in China, showed that patients with severe disease frequently had an increased IgG response [108] [109] [110] . These accumulated data raise the possibility of ADE by antibodies in COVID-19, and close attention should be paid to the matter. In addition to antibody concentration/affinity and viral load, there are two other ways in which ADE can be avoided. Both involve the Fc, the interacting partner on the virus-antibody complexes that initiates ADE. Nanobodies lacking the Fc domain would potentially avoid the pitfall of ADE [111]']",Mutations can potentially diminish or abolish the effectiveness of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.,"Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to impact the effectiveness of antibodies against the virus. Some mutations may lead to increased transmissibility, reduced efficacy of antibody treatments, and lower antibody neutralization.

128,What role do monoclonal antibodies play in understanding NDV genotype antigenic sites?,"[' to react to (and neutralize) a broad range of different NDV genotypes; this in turn may also relate to cross-protection against currently circulating field strains after vaccination with genotypically distant strains.Further studies on epitope mapping of MAbs will help to elucidate these specific epitopes. It will be interesting to learn whether genotype-specific antibodies recognize known binding sites but have a different amino acid configuration or whether the genotype 2.VII specific epitopes are formed by different sites. Overall our studies highlight the value of MAb to dissect antigenic sites. The established MAbs are the first step to define genotype 2.VII specific neutralizing sites of NDV based on sequence information and should enable phylogenic analysis of antigenic sites in the future, a prerequisite to elucidate whether antigenic drift was the driving factor for evolution of NDV. In addition, well defined MAbs serve as valuable diagnostic tools to specifically detect NDV antigen for example in lateral flow devices or can be used for serological tests. When, for example, applied in blocking ELISA systems genotype specific reagents would allow to differentiate infected from vaccinated individuals (DIVA) by specifically detecting genotype 2.I, 2.II or 2.VII specific antibodies. The presented work flow provides a powerful method to generate and characterize these reagents.', "" [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Studies with MAbs established with the apathogenic strain NDV-D26 (genotype 2.I.1.1) established three different epitopes sensitive for both HI and NI activity of MAbs and mapped these sites to different amino acids when escape variants were analyzed [34] . Likewise HI-positive MAb AVS-I, raised against the avirulent LaSota vaccine strain (genotype 2.II) [35] mapped to aa residue 570 that was close to but not part of the other described epitopes [36] . This indicates that NDV strains might express at least slightly different neutralizing epitope patterns. Information for such epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII is not available.In order to characterize antigenic sites of circulating NDV genotype 2.VII, we generated genotype-specific MAbs that are able to block biologically active sites of the HN protein, i.e. antibodies that are able to neutralize infectivity and/or block HA activity. For this approach biophysically enriched HN protein fraction of purified virus proved to be an efficient antigen and the applied Concanavalin A (ConA)-ELISA technique that binds antigen not directly on the plate but coupled by the lectin, provided a high throughput system suitable to detect antibodies to conformation sensitive sites. The resulting MAbs were used to recognize unique neutralizing epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII.NDV strain chicken/EGY/NR730/2016 (NR730; Gen-Bank Acc. no. MH899939) was isolated from an ND vaccinated layer flock in Egypt suffering from respiratory distress. The virus was characterized as velogenic having an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 1.8 and belonged to genotype 2.VII.1.1 (formerly 2.VIIb) [37] . Pigeon type paramyxovirus-1 (pigeon/Germany/ R75/1998), genotype 2.VI, was derived from the repository of the ND reference laboratory at the FLI (Acc. No. KJ736742) and NDV/clone 30, genotype 2.II, was derived from a commercial vaccine (MSD, New Jersey, USA). As a source of polyclonal reference antibodies, watery egg yolk preparation from eggs from specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens was used, immunized repeatedly with specified inactivated NDV antigens. A monospecific rabbit α-NDV-HN serum and α-NDV-F serum [38] were used for specific detection of NDV-HN protein by western blot (WB) analysis. Immunizations were carried out in accordance with the legally approved protocol (MV-LALLF-7221.3-2.5-010/10).Virus was propagated in embryonated SPF chicken eggs (ECE) as described [39] (VALO BioMedia GmbH, Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany). Amino-allantoic fluid (AAF) was harvested on day 3 post infection (dpi) and purified by sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation. Briefly, debris was cleared from AAF by low speed centrifugation (30 min at 10,976 × g; 10,000 rpm Rotor JA-10; Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). Then virus was spun down by ultra-centrifugation (1.5 h at 96,281 × g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor, Beckman Coulter). Virus pellets from 6 tubes were re-suspended in a total of 45 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 1 M KCl (KCl-PBS) before adding 15 mL of the virus suspension on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30-60%, in KCl-PBS). Visible bands forming after ultra-centrifugation overnight (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter) were collected and diluted 1:5 in KCl-PBS before pelleting the virus by ultra-centrifugation for 1.5 h (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter). The final virus pellets, representing a total of 228 mL AAF were collected and resuspended in 1.5 ml KCl-PBS.

247,"How does resource re-allocation during COVID-19 impact existing services, especially in oncology care and healthcare professionals' mental health?","[""going re-shuffling and re-allocating of resource (human and budget) which puts additional strain on existing services that were already at full capacity. Figures from China's National Health Commission demonstrated that more than 3300 healthcare workers were infected, and 22 had died related to COVID-19 [40] . As the pandemic accelerates providing PPE to deliver safe oncology services is a key concern worldwide [12] . If acute care services are at maximum capacity, institutions may provide alternative provisions for the care of people affected by cancer. Therefore, oncology nurses will need to be flexible to facilitate the safe delivery of alternative models of care. Alternative and adaptive models of care could increase the use of community care or private facilities.Following an analysis of nationwide data in China, a number of major strategies were put forward in the clinical management of cancer during this COVID-19 crisis [12] . First, that of intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery for people with low risk cancers. Second, should surgery suites and personnel be seconded elsewhere or are unavailable, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be considered for timely delivery of oncologic manoeuvres for some malignancies. Hypofractionated radiotherapy protocols should be prescribed whenever possible [41] , including single fraction treatments for uncomplicated bone metastases [42] . Third, protective approaches such as PPE and personal space modifications should be considered, see Table 3 . During chemotherapy administration, treatment beds or chairs should be placed with adequate space (1.5 meters) to prevent close contact as much as possible. Limiting or eliminating family attendance, while stressful, may be necessary in limited chemotherapy suite spaces. In such cases, portable technology such as smart phones or iPads could be loaned during the treatment session for patient and family support and subsequently disinfected between patient usage. Finally, more intensive surveillance during and in the recovery period should be considered when patients with cancer are infected with COVID-19, especially older patients and those with multiple co-morbidities [12] .People affected by cancer with family members or those in close contact who are infected, or suspected with COVID-19, should isolate from these contacts. Patients in such circumstances should be advised to inform their cancer care centre of any quarantine requirements. It is important that current health department recommendations regarding isolation and quarantine are followed. All cancer centres should display the symptoms of COVID-19 disease, criteria for when medical advice should be sought, and state the appropriate mode of presentation. For example, services may use a telephone triage, dedicated COVID-19 community assessment clinics [43] while some countries have built new COVID-19 hospitals within a very short timeframe with isolation and testing facilities.When facing a large-scale public health event, such as COVID-19, the physical and psychological strain on healthcare professionals cannot be underestimated [44] . It has been documented that the main concerns from healthcare staff during the COVID-19 outbreak in China have included being afraid of bringing the virus to their home and families [45] . Staff articulated a lack of support in how to manage patients when they were unwilling to be quarantined at the hospital, or when patients did not cooperate with medical measures because of panic [45] . Finally, staff articulated concerns about the shortage of PPE and feelings of incapability when faced with critically ill patients [45] and difficult decision-making in the allocation continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and ventilators.Experiences of health professionals during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak indicate a sequel of depression, anxiety, fear, frustration [46] and post-traumatic stress [44] .Research is currently underway looking into the mental impact of working in the frontline with people infected by COVID-19. Initial data from a large sample (n=1257) in China suggest similar patterns, with half of the sample of frontline staff experiencing depression and anxiety [47] . In fact, being a female nurse indicated a higher risk for depression, anxiety and psychological distress [47] .Caring for deteriorating patients across all ages increases emotional strain and physical exhaustion [48] . This experience can be exacerbated when caring for people with cancer; additional burden is placed on overworked nursing staff as the focus shifts to life-preservation leaving no space for reflection. Re-allocation of the workforce to manage the pandemic can also increase feelings of anxiety due to potential lack of familiarity the new role [30] . These factors can result in suppressing the natural process of grief and loss and in the long-term may lead to faster professional burnout [48] .Anxiety and depression are two of the most commonly experienced effects of cancer and its treatment [49] ; these can be heightened in the face of an additional life-threatening condition such as COVID-19.

While all the patient-focused interventions had a positive result, two out of three interventions directed at HCPs did not. It is noteworthy that these passive and asynchronous strategies could easily be ignored, whereas the patient-oriented strategies were active and synchronous, requiring immediate action, which could prove valuable during a mass vaccination campaign. That said, HCPs might now have a much different emotional and cognitive response to COVID-19 than influenza, and new intervention strategies should be investigated. The significant positive results found by Lorini et al 31 could for instance be due to the already large impact of COVID-19 affecting inclination towards vaccination among HCPs. Other studies have shown vaccine hesitancy among skilled nursing facility staff regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, either because of the development and testing or personal fears of getting sick. 63 An effective behaviour change strategy for COVID-19 vaccines uptake will therefore need to address multiple beliefs and behavioural determinants, by reducing barriers and leveraging enablers. 64 Text-based reminders have for instance been shown to be effective to get patients vaccinated, especially when designed to make them feel ownership of the vaccine dose, 65 66 and that the vaccine dose was reserved for them. 65 This has also been tested on actual uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. 66 This is something future nudging studies need to explore when it comes to HCPs.Nudging antibiotic prescriptions Appropriate hospital antibiotic use is a key element in patient safety, and it has been shown that antibiotics are often unnecessary in the treatment of COVID-19. 67 Although bacterial co-pathogens are common in viral respiratory infections, the prevalence of bacterial infections in patients with COVID-19 is not well understood. 68 Hence, the prevention of inappropriate antibiotic use is important not only to reduce the risk of opportunistic infections and other adverse drug events, but also to deter the natural selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 69 70 Our review indicates that social interventions such as public pledges, public-facing commitment letters and peer comparisons can effectively reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. EHRs or electronic prescription systems are important tools for changing prescribing behaviour. Both passive and active strategies have shown promise for reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. Health providers should not only consider how medications are displayed, but also the steps required to complete an order as possible windows of opportunities to deliver nudging interventions via the EHR.Using the two-dimensional view of nudging The active/passive and synchronous/asynchronous dimensions are practical in characterising how and when HCPs are exposed to the nudging intervention, without requiring deep knowledge of behavioural economics or behavioural psychology.These two dimensions created four quadrants, each containing different nudging strategies (figure 3). While active strategies enable the clinician to consciously reflect on the target behaviour, passive strategies can reduce their cognitive burden by making a behaviour easier or automatic.Evidence suggests that different nudging techniques can be used in clinical settings as simple, cost-effective strategies to fight COVID-19, reduce complications for intubated patients, improve hand hygiene, increase vaccination rates and avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. These strategies could be important in the continued handling of the pandemic, which will not be over until the whole world reaches herd immunity from vaccination.

70,How does flexible imitation contribute to suppressing epidemics?,"['Flexible imitation suppresses epidemics through better vaccination\nThe development of vaccines is one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. They save millions of lives yearly, not only by giving immunity to people exposed to an infection but also by stopping disease outbreaks. Most famously, perhaps, vaccine drove the eradication of smallpox. [1] At the time of writing, vaccines are the main hope for a pharmaceutical solution to the COVID-19 crisis. [2] [3] [4] To be able to evaluate interventions involving vaccination, we need to model the selection of who gets vaccinated and how that affects epidemics. [5] Creating such models is a very challenging task to which this paper seeks to contribute. [6, 7] The main difficulty lies in the complex feedback mechanisms between the epidemics itself and the decision to get vaccinated. [8] [9] [10] Not only are there irrational anti-vaccination sentiments that themselves spread through social contagion, [11, 12] but sometimes not getting vaccinated is a perfectly rational choice.When the population level of immunity is high enough, an outbreak will die out by itself. If this is the case, the population is said to have herd immunity. Even if the vaccine is effective, the marginal benefit of getting vaccinated in a society with herd immunity is small. [13] On top of this, a vaccine could be costly, inefficient, laden with side-effects, or inconvenient to administer. [14] For an individual, the reality is often between these extremes and not a choice between a cheap lifesaver or a costly unnecessity. Thus, this choice is known in the literature as the vaccination dilemma. [15, 16] Assume the vaccine is effective but has some side-effects (although much milder than the disease itself). Then one can model the rational-choice aspect of vaccination within * holme@cns.pi.titech.ac.jp the framework of game theory. [7, 17] As often is the case, behavioural and economic game theorists both take an interest in this problem, with somewhat different starting points. The behavioural game-theory line of research typically focuses on herd immunity as a public goodsomething valuable and accessible without competition to anyone in society. [9, 10] Like other public goods, herd immunity is prone to free-riding people who undermine the good by avoiding vaccination. [18] Economic game theorists instead think of vaccination as a decision based on an individual\'s costs and benefits, and regard herd immunity as a positive externality. The truth lies in between these pictures. [8] Benefiting a public good is not the most common driving force behind an individual\'s vaccination decisions. [19, 20] It would also make little sense to get vaccinated to contribute to herd immunity if very few others were vaccinated, which is precisely when the private benefits are the largest. [13] On the other hand, herd immunity and, ultimately, eradication of a disease are the primary goals at a national level, [3, 4] and thus more than a mere externality.There is a growing research interest in game-theoretic studies of vaccination. [6, 17] For articles in the economic game-theory literature, see e.g. Geoffard and Philipson [8] or Francis [13] and further references therein. In the evolutionary game-theory literature, early works coupled game theory and epidemic dynamics by differential-equation based models. [21] Later, authors recognised that social interaction structures are better modelled by networks. For example, in Fu et al. [15] individuals compare their fitness to randomly selected network neighbours to determine whether or not to imitate the neighbour. The phrases ""fitness"" and ""payoff"" (that in this paper are synonymous) come from the gametheory literature and capture the ability to avoid infection minus the cost associated with the vaccination. Other authors have extended the use of imitation dynamics. Zhang et al. [22] , for example, considered the possibility that deci-arXiv:2009.00443v2 [q-bio.PE] 12 Oct 2020 The plots also show two initial fractions of conformists, c = 0.5 (blue curves) and c = 0.9 (yellow curves). The population seems unable (respectively, able) to eventually reduce the outbreak size irrespective of the memory length when the initial fraction of conformists is high (moderate). Short (long) memory seems insufficient (sufficient) to trigger a substantial interchange of imitation mechanisms among individuals compared to the initial state. Long memory thus helps to eliminate outbreaks when the initial fraction of conformists is moderate (blue curve in panel (b)). Here, the infection rate is relatively large, β = 2. The networks are constructed by the Erdős-Rényi model with N = 64 nodes and the average degree k = 2, which ensures the existence of a giant component (that essentially all nodes belong to). Time is measured in the']",Flexible imitation contributes to suppressing epidemics by better vaccination.,"Flexible imitation helps suppress epidemics by allowing individuals to adapt their imitation mechanisms based on experience. In the context of vaccination decisions, individuals can choose between conformist and performist strategies when deciding whether to vaccinate. By dynamically switching between these imitation mechanisms, individuals can learn the best course of action to combat epidemics through better vaccination. This adaptability helps improve vaccination coverage and ultimately reduces the outbreak size of diseases.","How does flexible imitation contribute to suppressing epidemics? ->: Flexible imitation helps suppress epidemics by allowing individuals to adapt their imitation mechanisms based on experience.

Flexible imitation can contribute to suppressing epidemics by allowing individuals to adapt their behavior to changing circumstances. For example, during a pandemic, individuals may need to adjust their social distancing measures based on the severity of the outbreak. By allowing individuals to imitate each other's behavior in a flexible manner, the spread of the virus can be slowed down, and the epidemic can be suppressed more effectively.

209,How does physical exercise affect susceptibility to infections?,"[""How Physical Exercise Influences the Establishment of Infections\nDuring exercise, leucocytes are recruited to the blood, and if muscle damage occurs the cytokine level is enhanced. After prolonged, intense exercise the number of lymphocytes in the blood is reduced, and the function of natural killer cells is suppressed; furthermore, secretory immunity is impaired. During this time of immunodepression, often referred to as 'the open window' , the host may be more susceptible to micro-organisms bypassing the first line of defence. This is of interest to top athletes who perform frequent severe exercise. Clinical observations regarding an increased risk of infections in top athletes are compatible with this model. However, in those performing regular moderate exercise the immune system will often be temporarily enhanced and this will protect these individuals from infections.During the past few years there has been a growing interest in understanding how exercise influences the immune system. Research into exercise immunology has been stimulated by: (a) reports of increased frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) among athletes;[l] (b) the finding that in addition to physical exercise several other physical stressors (e.g. surgery, trauma, burn, hypoxia and hyperthermia) induce changes in the cellular immune system; [2] and (c) the possibility that increased levels of some neuroendocrine factors (e.g. catecholamines and growth hormone) may modulate the immune response.f3] This article summarises some of the important findings on exercise and the first line defence mechanisms of the immune system.It is well known that exercise alters the distribution and trafficking of peripheral mononuclear cells.l 4 ] The first English-language publication reporting exercise-induced leucocytosis was by Larrabee in 1902, [5] who described the phenomenon in a small group of marathon runners. Peripheral blood leucocytosis after exercise has been shown to be due to increased concentrations of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. The neutrophil concentration increases during and after exercise.l 4 ,6] During exercise, natural killer (NK), Band T cells are also recruited to the blood, resulting in an elevated total lymphocyte count. The subpopulation composition of T cells is altered, with the CD4+/CD8+ ratio decreasing because the number of CD8+ T cells increases more than the number of CD4+ cells, After intense exercise, the lymphocyte level decreases below pre-exercise values, and the duration of this suppression depends on the intensity and duration of exercise,l3]NK cells are a heterogeneous population of cells that mediate the killing of a broad range of target cellsP] They are thought to play an important role in the first line of defence against acute and chronic viral infections and tumour spread. [8] The modulation of NK cell activity in response to exercise has been investigated extensively.[9-36] During physical exercise, the absolute concentration and the relative fraction of blood mononuclear cells (BMNC) expressing characteristic NK cell markers are markedly enhanced. Simultaneously, the cytotoxic activity of NK cells (the function of NK cells) increases. After intense exercise, NK cell activity is suppressed.l 9 -36 ] Among several hypotheses regarding the mechanism behind the postexercise suppression of NK cell activity, one has addressed the possibility that the activity is suppressed by prostaglandins released by the elevated number of monocytes,l29,32]The secretory immune system of mucosal tissues such as the upper respiratory tract is considered to be the first barrier to colonisation by pathogenic micro-organisms which might cause URTI.l37,38] In mucosal secretions immunoglobulin (Ig) A is the major class of immunoglobulins, and the level of IgA in mucosal fluids has been shown to correlate more closely with resistance to URTI than serum antibodies. [39] Tomasi et a1. [40] reported suppressed levels of salivary IgA in cross-country skiers after a race. This finding was confirmed by a 70% decrease in salivary IgA for several hours after 2 hours of intense ergometer cycling.[41] Decreased salivary IgA was found after swimming,[42] and salivary IgA was low for several hours after marathon running.l 43 ] In order to study the mechanism behind the suppression of immunoglobulins, a plaque forming cell (PFC) assay was used. This assay allows the identification of the individual immunoglobulin-secreting cells of blood. Stimulation of cells, in vitro, with pokeweed mitogen (PWM), interleukin (IL)-2 or Epstein-Barr virus (EBY) resulted in significantly decreased numbers of IgG-, IgA-and IgM-secreting blood cells both during and 2 hours after exercise, with recovery after 1 day.144] Purified B cells produce plaques only""]","During exercise, leucocytes are recruited to the blood, and if muscle damage occurs the cytokine level is enhanced.

NCDs and humanitarian crises often co-occur in LMICs, providing additional challenges for the management of NCDs in these settings where weak health systems collide with the challenges of a humanitarian response. The number of displaced persons (either refugees or internally displaced) has reached the highest level in history, estimated at more than 70 million people [2] . Until recently NCDs in humanitarian contexts were a neglected issue [3, 4] . Humanitarian contexts are changing. Protracted crises are now also impacting higher income regions, such as the Middle East, and more displaced persons are settling in urban areas rather than traditional camp settings [5, 6] . This results in impacted populations being more likely to have pre-existing NCDs. All these factors influence the burden of NCDs seen in humanitarian crises as well as the approaches needed to address NCD-related health needs.The WHO\'s Global Action Plan (GAP) for the Prevention and Control of NCDs for 2013-2020 includes recommendations regarding NCDs in the humanitarian response [7] . This document states ""it must be ensured that the use of the services does not expose the users to financial hardship, including in cases of ensuring the continuity of care in the aftermath of emergencies and disasters."" The recommendations also highlight the need to ""improve the availability of life-saving technologies and essential medicines for managing NCDs in the initial phase of an emergency response."" Continuity of care in this context refers to: ""access to comprehensive services and interventions that address the health needs and the well-being of a person, from the identification of a health condition until the recovery of a functional state consistent with the context"" [8] .Given the relatively recent focus on NCDs during emergencies, humanitarian actors recognized the need to harmonize and enhance NCD management in humanitarian crises. Indeed, the humanitarian community has increasingly addressed the needs for NCD care in their activities [9] and developed organization-specific programmatic and clinical guidance. However, there is a lack of a standardized response during operations [3, 10, 11] , which is essential to guarantee continuity of services to people in crisis settings, as well as a lack of evidencebased NCD management guidelines in humanitarian settings [12, 13] . WHO\'s Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN), provides a basis for NCD care in LMICs, but needs to be adapted to humanitarian settings to address the additional challenges of NCD care during crisis, which include disruption of health care services due to damaged and destroyed health facilities, lack of health care workers, difficulties in access to health facilities due to security constraints or damaged infrastructure. Therefore, a common approach of all actors in the field is needed to answer to the needs of patients with NCDs in crisis settings. The aim of this paper is to present operational considerations, aiming at ensuring appropriate planning, management and care for NCD-affected persons during humanitarian emergencies.The informal working group on NCDs in humanitarian settings, formed by members of the WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and others, and led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), teamed up with the University of Geneva and Geneva University Hospitals in order to develop the operational considerations needed to address NCDs in humanitarian settings. This was done by applying a modified nominal group approach through a series of face to face meetings and email exchanges, informed by expert knowledge and relevant literature [14] .Humanitarian response interventions are usually prioritized according to needs and resources. NCDs encompass a spectrum of diseases and care requirements, and a prioritization of NCD services/interventions are required based on the available resources (human, financial, etc.) and on the context [15] . The list of conditions considered as a priority is based on feasibility during an acute humanitarian crisis, burden of disease and demand, avoidable premature deaths as defined in the priority NCDs of the WHO [7] , those which have severe consequences if left untreated [16] , and pre-crisis availability and capacity of the health system [17] .The priority NCDs to be included in humanitarian responses, as defined by the informal working group, are cardiovascular diseases (including heart failure of any etiology and coronary heart disease), high blood pressure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), epilepsy and diabetes.

176,How does the volume of intranasal inoculum affect virus distribution in mice and hamsters?,"['] .The level of anesthesia can influence the outcome of influenza infection in mice. Mice infected under anesthesia develop pneumonia, while infection is limited to the upper respiratory tract when awake mice are infected [31, 32] . The volume of inoculum administered intranasally also influences the extent to which virus is distributed in the respiratory tract [32] . Immunologically, the lack of a functional Mx gene in standard laboratory strains of mice is a disadvantage of this model for studies in which the innate immune response to infection is important [33, 34] . However, the ready availability of mice, their relatively low cost, the available variety of genetic backgrounds and targeted genetic defects, and the immunological reagents available still make the mouse an attractive and heavily utilized animal model for studies on influenza.Influenza virus infection of hamsters with non-adapted human influenza viruses does not result in clinical disease, but the virus replicates to high titers in the nasal turbinates and lungs following an intranasal infection [35] [36] [37] . As with mice, the hamster represents a readily available small animal model that can be used for pre-clinical evaluation of candidate vaccines, but it has not been as extensively used as mice for studies of inactivated influenza virus vaccines. The body temperature of Golden Syrian hamsters is about 39 C, while that of mice is 37 C. Thus, hamsters have been used for the evaluation of live attenuated temperature-sensitive vaccines with shut-off temperatures !38.8 C [38] .Guinea pigs can be infected with non-adapted human influenza viruses, although the amount of virus needed to infect guinea pigs is about ten times more than the amount needed to infect hamsters or ferrets [39] . Infection of guinea pigs with A/England/42/72 (H3N2) did not result in febrile illness or other clinical signs of influenza infection. The virus was isolated from the nasal washes of animals infected with influenza A/England/42/72 (H3N2), A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) or A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) viruses, but titers of virus shed in the nasal secretions were not as high as those observed following experimental infection of ferrets. Infection of guinea pigs with influenza A/HK/1/68 (H3N2) virus resulted in pneumonia, which developed slowly and was reversible. This model was used to study the effects of environmental pollutants or drugs on the respiratory tract [40] . Lowen and colleagues [41] reported that guinea pigs of the Hartley strain are highly susceptible to non-adapted influenza A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) virus. Intranasal infection resulted in virus replication in the nose and lungs, with higher titers of virus being recovered from the lungs. The virus could be recovered from the upper respiratory tract for up to 9 days post inoculation, whereas shedding declined to undetectable levels in the lungs by day 5. Virus replication was not associated with any effects on body temperature or weight of the animals, and no other clinical signs of illness were observed.Common laboratory strains of rat are described as ""semi-permissive"" for influenza infection, and infant rats are of some utility in the evaluation of live attenuated influenza vaccines, but they have not been used extensively to study influenza infection [42] [43] [44] .The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) has been used in the laboratory as a model for several infectious diseases (reviewed in [45] ). In particular, the cotton rat model was extensively used in the development of therapeutic antibody treatments for RSV and has provided much useful information for vaccine development against this pathogen. Sadowski and co-workers reported that intranasal administration of human influenza virus to lightly anesthetized, outbred young adult cotton rats resulted in virus replication in the respiratory tract, the production of pulmonary lesions and a strong immune response [46] . In recent years, there has been some renewed interest in the cotton rat as a laboratory animal model for human influenza virus infection. Species-specific reagents that permit more detailed analysis of viral pathogenesis and immune responses in this species have been developed [45] and inbred cotton rats are now available. The advantages of this model include the fact that cotton rats can be infected by non-adapted human influenza viruses, inbred animals are available, the virus replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract, some clinical parameters can be measured, and viral infection results in histopathological changes in the lungs that are similar to those seen during natural infection of humans [47] . To date only a limited number of human influenza viruses have been evaluated in cotton rats.Ferrets are exquisitely susceptible to infection with human influenza viruses. The initial isolation of a human influenza virus by Smith and colleagues was from ferrets [17']",The volume of inoculum administered intranasally also influences the extent to which virus is distributed in the respiratory tract.,"The volume of intranasal inoculum can influence the extent to which the virus is distributed in the respiratory tract of mice. Studies have shown that the volume of inoculum administered intranasally influences the distribution of the virus in the respiratory tract of mice.

The volume of intranasal inoculum affects virus distribution in mice and hamsters by influencing the number of virus particles that are deposited in the nasal cavity and the subsequent distribution of virus in the respiratory tract.

Hence, in such a case, options to elongate the half-life of nanobody candidates should be taken before moving to the clinic. These may include linking a nanobody to anti-human serum albumin (HSA), a technique that has been proven to increase the serum half-life to~6 days in cynomolgus monkeys [112] . Another strategy to circumvent ADE is the introduction of a LALA mutation (Leu234Ala together with Leu235Ala) into the Fc to minimize FcR activation and Fc-mediated toxicity of human antibody candidates against SARS-CoV-2. This has been done with JS016 (currently in clinical trial) which employs a LALA mutation in the Fc to minimize FcγR activation and Fcmediated toxicity, and also with antibody CB6 where CB6-LALA is currently being investigated in clinical trials (Table 1 ) [71] .We are currently experiencing an explosion of research into antibodies to combat COVID-19 that include neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1 ) and therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. To date, 8 neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical evaluation -LY-CoV555, JS016, REGN-COV2, TY027, BRII-196, BRII-198, CT-P59, and SCTA01. It is understood that SARS-CoV-2 may develop resistance to a single neutralizing antibody by accumulating spontaneous mutations [88, 89] . To overcome this problem, antibody cocktails such as REGN-COV2, AZD7442, and COVI-SHIELD have entered clinical trials (Table 1) . Further, multiple research programs have also started to work on antibodies against conserved epitopes that would avoid the SARS-CoV-2 mutations that are currently being observed in the pandemic. This will enable us to get ahead of the potential issue of viral resistance [53, 81, 88, 89, 113, 114] . Efforts will also be necessary to discover conserved functional neutralizing epitopes that, once mutated, can cause SARS-CoV-2 to lose its infectivity. To circumvent the potential problem of ADE, several strategies are being explored, including the use of nanobodies lacking the Fc domain and the introduction of the LALA mutation into the Fc domain.Given the development of fruitful concurrent pipelines of antibodies against COVID-19 driven by close collaboration between academia and industry, we hold optimism that broadly neutralizing candidates will emerge that induce less or no ADE, and thus play a major role in therapy and protection against COVID-19. Over the next few years we are likely to see an expansion of preclinical research and gain extensive experience in the development of antibodies against COVID-19 in the clinic. An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 will better prepare us for the next pandemic (see Outstanding Questions).We thank Dr Shaolei Teng (Howard University) for sharing the analysis of mutations on S protein of SARS-CoV-2. We thank all colleagues from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) COVID-19 team for helpful comments and advice in the preparation of this manuscript. This research was supported in by the NCATS Intramural Research Program of the NIH. What is the best strategy to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies against conserved epitopes of SARS-CoV-2?What are the ways to combat antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) from neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19?', '] . Although the frequencies of these mutations are low, and none has been found to be enriched in the current pandemic, these highlight that such mutations can potentially diminish or abolish the effectiveness of the currently available and in-developmentantibodies [66, 87] . Because spontaneously arising mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains can be positively selected, and ultimately become the dominant strain to achieve viral escape under pressure from a neutralizing antibody [88] [89] [90] [91] , strategies have been developed to protect against this. One strategy is to design broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the RBD because these are less likely to mutate [92] [93] [94] . Another method to combat potential escape mutants is to use a combination of several neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies in cocktails would target distinct epitopes, enabling an additive effect in potency. Indeed, such strategies have been employed for earlier outbreaks, as seen in Ebola (REGN-EB3) and SARS-CoV-1 (antibody cocktail of CR3014 and CR3022) [66] . These previous successes spurred Regeneron to start the development of a dual antibody cocktail for COVID-19 (REGN-COV2, a combination of two antibodies, REGN10933 + REGN10987; Table 1 ) [88, 89] . AstraZeneca has also confirmed a pair of mAbs (AZD8895 + AZD1061) that will be taken forward as a combination therapy, known as AZD7442, into clinical development (Table 1 ). It is anticipated that this cocktail strategy may be crucial in increasing the potency of antibodies for use against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutating strains.Antibodies represent a double-edged sword in that they can both neutralize and enhance viral infection [95] : highly potent neutralizing antibodies can recognize specific viral epitopes and block viral entry to the host cells, whereas poorly neutralizing antibodies can promote infection through a phenomenon known as ADE. ADE is seen in responses to many infectious diseases including dengue fever, in which the natural progression of the disease has been shown to utilize antibodies from the primary response to infection as a basis for increased severity in later secondary infections [96] . Similarly, poorly neutralizing antibodies or antibodies with low affinity can promote virus entry upon secondary infection, resulting in increased viral burden and more severe disease progression via ADE (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] . Mechanisms of ADE largely rely on the uptake of virus-antibody immune complexes into host immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes, a process that is mediated through interactions between the Fc domain on the antibodies and Fc receptor (FcR) on host cells. These virus-antibody immune complexes in turn initiate different downstream proinflammatory signaling pathways, leading to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased viral load (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] .ADE has previously been observed for antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 [100] [101] [102] . Upon rechallenge in SARS-CoV-1-vaccinated rhesus macaques, passive transfer of anti-spike IgG correlated with disease progression, as observed by the presence of severe diffuse alveolar damage and loss of disease tolerance [103, 104] . It was observed that the same antisera against SARS-CoV-1 may confer neutralization or enhancement based solely on the concentrations of the antisera employed where enhancement and neutralization occur at lower and higher concentrations, respectively [102] . Thus, a threshold dependent on both antibody concentration and affinity may need to be considered in aiming to confer neutralization instead of enhancement [103] .Convalescent plasma therapy for infectious diseases is also known to be more effective as a prophylactic if administered shortly after symptoms arise when viral titers are thought to be lower [31, 105, 106] , suggesting that the threshold of viral load is also an important factor to consider. Although to date (as of 28 July 2020) there have been no observations of ADE in antibodies currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 [107] , in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as two early clinical studies in China, showed that patients with severe disease frequently had an increased IgG response [108] [109] [110] . These accumulated data raise the possibility of ADE by antibodies in COVID-19, and close attention should be paid to the matter. In addition to antibody concentration/affinity and viral load, there are two other ways in which ADE can be avoided. Both involve the Fc, the interacting partner on the virus-antibody complexes that initiates ADE. Nanobodies lacking the Fc domain would potentially avoid the pitfall of ADE [111]']","The best strategy to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies against conserved epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 is to target conserved epitopes in the RBD and use a combination of several neutralizing antibodies. To combat antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) from neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19, strategies include using nanobodies lacking the Fc domain and designing antibodies with high affinity and concentration to confer neutralization instead of enhancement.","To develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and combat antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in COVID-19, several strategies can be utilized:

1. Target Conserved Epitopes: Design antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus. These conserved epitopes are less likely to mutate, thus providing a more effective long-term solution.

2. Antibody Cocktails: Use a combination of several neutralizing antibodies in cocktails. These cocktails should target distinct epitopes on the virus, which will provide an additive effect in potency and reduce the likelihood of escape mutants.

3. Fc Modifications: Modify the Fc domain of antibodies to minimize Fc receptor activation and Fc-mediated toxicity. Strategies like introducing LALA mutations into the Fc domain can help in avoiding ADE.

4. Nanobodies: Utilize nanobodies that lack the Fc domain. While this may shorten in vivo half-life, strategies like linking nanobodies to anti-human serum albumin can help elongate their half-life, making them effective against the virus.

40,What is the gender workload gap in the gig economy?,"[' p < 0.01). Moreover, this disparity appeared for other two groups: 18-24 (mean number of lessons given: x men 18-24 = 68.79, x women 18-24 = 62.03, t = 2.74, p < 0.01) and 25-29 (mean number of lessons given: x men 25-29 = 69.14, x women 25-29 = 58.86, t = 2.75, p < 0.01). To summarize, the gender differences in workload that were related to age could be partially attributed to the distribution of work hours (RQ3). We might suggest that these differences may emerge due to the limited availability of women in the evenings, despite evening hours being the most indemand for students.Gender inequality has long been an important economic and societal challenge. Quota systems and parental leave for fathers have been implemented in many countries toward achieving gender equality 25, 28 . Continuing labour market changes tied to online platform development (the gig economy) have created unique opportunities for flexible working arrangements and home-based work. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ This article examined gender inequality in a gig economy case study, in search of potential explanations for the gender workload gap. Using the data on teachers\' workload for the online platform Skyeng, we considered the gender differences in workload and tried to explain it through age and working hours distribution. Although women held most of the teaching positions in the Skyeng online school, the women had fewer working hours than the men. These differences were significant under the age of 35 and smoothed out for older groups. A similar age-related trend has been previously shown in other studies, but it demonstrated the difference in earnings based on data from US Census 44, 45 . In this research, we suggest that the observed workload gap could be partially attributed to differences in a workday organization: i.e. women work less during evenings.Although we did not collect data on teachers\' marital or family status, considering that mothers\' mean age of childbirth in Russia in 2019 was 29 48 , we may be able to associate the lack of workload with these women\'s caregiving duties. In line with previous study results 17 , we found that the women, on average, worked less than the men in the evening. We could suppose that these hours were often devoted to childcare and time with family.It is worth noting that our research was limited to data on activity logs and the personal characteristics of the teachers in our sample. Although this allowed us to track actual teachers\' working patterns, we could not detect the causal mechanisms behind the formation of differences. Further survey-based studies, interviews, and focus groups are necessary to shed light on male and female working experiences in the broader gig economy and identify barriers to equal opportunities. Another issue is that we could not control the additional employment among teachers. Additionally, we should take into account that online teaching is not a gender-blind system compared to other tasks and projects within the gig economy. In this research we did not check whether students had any gender preferences, although further research should address this question.In conclusion, despite the home-office and flexibilization opportunities the gig economy has created, gender disparity has remained significant in this and other labour sectors. Due to various structural and individual-level factors, men have remained dominant in the labour sphere. Additionally, many jobs in the gig economy do not provide opportunities for professional development and career growth and could be considered ""dead-end"" jobs.Our findings concur with previous empirical results on the prevalence of a gender gap in the gig economy. The majority of studies on gender imbalance in the labour market were completed based on data from WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) societies 30, 49, 50 , which makes it challenging to understand labour market disparity in other societies. In this paper, we demonstrate that the workload gender gap is observed also in the CSI countries (former Soviet Union countries), so gender disparity holds in different societies.These findings have demonstrated that policymakers, experts, researchers, and the owners of gig economy platforms should develop additional measures to promote gender equality in this fast-growing labor sector. Besides, the implementation of such policies should account for regional specificity.Our results also highlight that women in the age group 30-35 are the most vulnerable group due to limited working capacity and potentially largest caring duties. Even flexible and distant working arrangements do not prevent the gender gap, especially for this group. Interestingly, recent studies even found that home-based work would be more financially beneficial to men 51 . Additionally, recent research documents this category also lacks in well-being 43, 45 which might be associated with the perceived unequal distribution of household duties, and work-family conflict 52 . Thus, we suggest paying additional attention to the identification of such vulnerable groups, detailed investigation of the multidimensional nature of the gender gap, and moreover, difficulties of women\'s development. Furthermore, we recommend to develop targeted programs aimed at the support of such risk categories.Additionally, we would like to']","The gender workload gap in the gig economy is significant, with women having fewer working hours than men, particularly under the age of 35.","The gender workload gap in the gig economy refers to the difference in workload between men and women working in flexible arrangements like the gig economy.

123,What factors led to the formation of the MEL and RTR coalitions and how do they sustain their alliances?,"["" Democrats (all members of RTR). Whereas the passing of the motion indicated the strong political clout built by RTR, the related legislation was defeated, with 36 members voting in favor and 60 voting against it.A similar window of opportunity contributed to the formation of the MEL coalition. With the approaching Portuguese local elections in October 2017, the group understood it was a pertinent moment to pressure central and local governments to urgently act on the housing problem, taking the forthcoming election as an opportunity to sensitize civil society on the housing issue (Mendes, 2020) . The interviewees explained that, up to that point, housing was not an important theme on the local political agenda-despite the increasing problem of displacement, evictions and rising rents-and housing interventions were scattered among different ministerial cabinets. 3 This point is illustrated further by this housing activist:At the time [local elections] we decided that it was a good time to form this movement because there was no government policy on housing. Lisbon Municipal Council did not have a program for low-income [earners], those people were being expelled from their homes. So, before the election MEL began to denounce this (Participant 40).The symbolic force of both coalitions cannot be explained only by the quality of the arguments or by the worsening of the housing crisis because other initiatives, such as policy papers and op-eds had already been produced by activists in previous years. The political force of MEL and RTR seems to be their capacity to connect a wide range of political actors around a common problematic situation, producing an interorganizational environment where participants bridge-build and bond through their efforts to create a unifying message, at least for a period of time. As noted by Moura (2019) , this type of approach employs bonds of solidarity and belonging, producing new opportunities for engagement and participation in collective action. As shown in Table 1 , RTR and MEL are composed of diverse entities, indicating the breadth of the housing movement. Some of the coalition members do not have housing as their primary identity, but the coalitions were capable of mobilizing groups that had previously embraced other issues, making clear demands that focus on the role of the state in responding effectively to the housing crisis. This unifying master frame (Benford and Snow 2000) was a determinant for coalition building and the development of alliances.The broad membership of RTR and MEL is their greatest advantage, but it is also their biggest vulnerability. As noted by Benford (1993) , differences among coalition groups are a weakness of social movements. The capacity to manage tensions within the coalition is a significant factor affecting the growth and maintenance of coalitions. While there is a clear benefit for coalitions when a range of participating organizations unify their capacities to pursue shared targets, real coalition work among different groups is difficult to realize. Ideological and strategic conflicts occur within RTR and MEL. Although the unified agenda of the various movements involves a rejection of the financialization of housing and a call for more state intervention in the provision of homes, their specific agendas, strategies and political views sometimes differ, even if some of their key ideologies overlap.The first main difficulty in sustaining housing coalitions in Dublin is related to housing policy itself. While some coalition members demand a stronger role for the state in the provision of housing, less radical members believe that the private sector can provide affordable housing below market prices. This is the source of many debates among coalition members. A second point of dissent often takes place around the organization of marches. Some members are keen to organize people and take to the streets, but other members, such as trade unions, are more careful. To them, a poorly attended demonstration is a political loss and could jeopardize the legitimacy of the movement, as illustrated by this representative of a trade union, a member of RTR:Marching is a public demonstration of legitimacy and it is a public demonstration of credibility and it is a number's game. If you announce that this is the greatest crisis in the history of the country, and you can only muster five people, well, then you are going to get commentators in the media that will say 'no, it is not quite obviously a serious issue' and move on. And the next time you say it, you will be ignored (Participant 26).Large entities are very careful with their public image, so trade unions are more cautious with the decisions they make. The third difficulty mentioned by research participants is more tactical, relating to the challenge of assembling a wide range of groups and negotiating a plan of action. While some groups are more focused on lobbying and policy solutions (i.e. parties, NGOs and trade unions), smaller groups are also interested in community organizing and in constructing an inclusive housing movement. So, while some groups prefer to focus on institutional activities, others prefer to organize tenants and push for more direct action, especially housing collectives that employ a direct action approach, such as the Irish Housing Network (IHN) and Take Back The City (TBTC), which are not in RTR ("", ' housing and to the city and is at the forefront of the national political debate in Lisbon, while focusing also on drawing the attention of civil society to housing-related issues (Mendes 2020) . The open letter turned out to be a strong point of connection among activists around the housing problem, leading to the formation of groups that had already existed to a certain extent but were too dispersed. Together, the groups and individuals that signed the letter created a new way to communicate with the public, as MEL is focused on organizational flexibility, public discussion and horizontality of representation. Commenting on the expansion of the group, one of MEL\'s first signatories said ""MEL was gaining space in public opinion because it has great media impact. We work a lot also through Facebook, online, so after a while we started to gain some representation with politicians"" (Participant 39). The group grew to be an important forum for dialogues with various political and institutional actors responsible for housing in the city, being invited for parliamentary hearings and to media appearances. MEL is coordinated by a committee of neighborhood associations and strongly supported by academics.The emergence and participation of so many housing groups suggests a keen interest in a sustained housing movement in Ireland, even if the housing activists have not yet been able to create an inclusive and sustained housing movement. The complex and diverse housing groups and coalitions that emerged in Lisbon in response to housing financialization and gentrification have been able to highlight the struggles of the urban poor. But how do members of MEL and RTR navigate in this complex, multi-actor, inter-organizational space to cooperate and sustain their coalitions? I examine these questions next.RTR involves experienced and resourceful activists, such as trade union members and political parties, who have aided the coalition in reaching the wider public. After a successful conference organized by the ICTU, the diverse groups in attendance agreed on the financial and unfair aspects of the housing crisis and observed that some smaller actions were taking place at local level. The logical conclusion then was to connect those groups around the same platform, as explained by this member of the RTR coalition, a representative of a trade union:""We had a whole range of smaller campaigns who had been essentially saying more or less the same thing over a longer period of time, not necessarily connecting up. So, on foot of that meeting we agreed we should work together as best as possible and try to create a broader civil society platform"" (Participant 14).Morar em Lisboa (MEL) started off as a small collective of six people publishing an open letter in the Trienal de Arquitectura de Lisboa (Lisbon Architecture Triennale). Put together by academics, housing activists and other entities, MEL quickly expanded to connect people and groups against gentrification and for the right to housing and the city. The founders intended to connect the various groups engaged in similar activities and focused on denouncing the fast-paced gentrification Lisbon was going through and its impact on local residents. As reported by an activist who was one of the first signatories of the open letter:We wanted a movement where we could denounce what is happening in this city. The issue of gentrification, a question that nobody was talking about at the time. The question of people being evicted when the rental contracts ended. It is a movement of denunciation and pressure and there were a lot of people thinking just that, so we brought them together (Participant 38).Both the RTR and MEL coalitions intended to make the best use of their capacity to attract a variety of organizations and individual participants to secure the widest possible support for the goals of the coalition. When it comes to coalition formation, timing was also an important factor. While the political threat of the worsening housing crisis is likely to have acted as a powerful connection among actors and spurred cooperation among them, another two specific political opportunities contributed to the emergence of these coalitions in that specific time and context: the prospect of new legislation in Ireland and the approaching local elections in Portugal.RTR organized a protest rally on October 3, 2018, to coincide with a vote on a multi-party motion in the Oireachtas (National Parliament) calling on the government to declare a housing emergency, a referendum on the right to housing, the building of more social housing and the provision of rent controls, among other demands. 2 Considering that groups join coalitions when they see their efforts on a particular set of issues as urgent and potentially efficacious (Heaney and Rojas 2014; Meyer and Corrigall-Brown 2005) , the multi-party motion spurred cooperation. If successfully passed, it was a concrete outcome and an important victory for the coalition. In fact, the public pressure created by the rally, and the direct attention on the motion, was successful and the motion was passed by a majority. The proposed bill was introduced by opposition parties: Sinn Féin, the Green Party, the Labour Party, People Before Profit, Solidarity, Independents4Change, and the Social']","The factors that led to the formation of the MEL and RTR coalitions were the political threat of the worsening housing crisis, the prospect of new legislation in Ireland, and the approaching local elections in Portugal.

We used the guidelines for interpretation of the household hunger scale by Ballard et al. (2011) [13] and scaled it accordingly for a reference period of 7 days. Thus, a hunger frequency of once in 7 days was classified as 'rarely'; 2 times in 7 days was classified as 'sometimes' (equivalent to 3-10 times in 30 days); 3 or more times in 7 days was classified as 'often' (equivalent to >10 times in 30 days). To investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and hunger, 'rarely' was recategorised as not hungry/food secure after combining cases with a 'never' response/at risk of food insecurity; 'sometimes' and 'often' were classified as hungry/food insecure.Breastfeeding information was collected only in the follow-up survey (July 2020). Currently breastfeeding was determined by a positive response to the question 'Yesterday, did you breastfeed your baby?'. The next question asked 'Yesterday, did you feed your baby formula or porridge such as Nestum?' to assess mixed feeding. If the answer to the first question was yes, and no to the second question, then a follow-up question was posed to identify predominant breastfeeding by asking if only breastmilk was given, if only formula or cereal was given, or if both breastmilk and formula or cereal was given in the seven days prior. These three questions were combined to create an indicator for predominant breastfeeding, categorising women as predominant breastfeeding if they breastfed their baby the previous day but did not feed them formula or porridge and also confirmed that over the past seven days they only gave their baby breastmilk (and no formula or infant cereal).Primary health care (PHC) facility attendance of pregnant women and mothers was assessed in the first survey by asking them when they last attended the clinic. To capture clinic attendance, we created a binary variable that was 1 if respondents had visited a clinic in the previous 2 months, and 0 if they had not.The follow-up survey included a question asking women to share their main concerns.It was an open-ended question and limited only by the 160-character limit of the SMS. Table 1 outlines the data collected in the first and follow-up rounds of the national survey. Data on child hunger were the only data collected in both rounds of the survey. Depressive symptom data were only collected in the first round of the survey, and all other data used in this study were collected in the follow-up round of the survey. The questions from the 2 surveys are available in the supplementary information provided (File S1). The two waves of the survey were analysed as a panel due to the proximity in time. Due to the survey format, the researchers were limited in what questions they could include, which in turn has constrained the study's ability to understand the relationships and patterns in more depth. Univariate analysis examined the prevalence of breastfeeding practices and hunger in the household. Bivariate analysis was employed to explore the associations between breastfeeding and maternal depression, and breastfeeding and hunger, as well as between breastfeeding and clinic attendance. In all cases a Pearson's chi-squared test was used to assess the significance of the relationship. We also included multivariate analysis where we explored whether the relationship between maternal hunger and breastfeeding was robust to the inclusion of PHC facility, depressive symptoms of the mother and the baby's age in a multivariate logistic regression. Throughout the paper, we employed a 5% cut-off for assessing the significance of a statistical relationship. Stata version 15.2 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for the statistical analysis.The respondent's responses to the question about what worried them most at the moment provided some confirmation of our concern that the pandemic had affected hunger, nutrition, and breastfeeding. Typical responses included the following: 'I worry about losing my life or my kids due to COVID-19 and not having food in the house, because as a breastfeeding mom I have to eat so that I can produce milk'; 'I am concerned about going to bed hungry when I have to breastfeed'; 'I am worried about my health and wellbeing together with good nutrition since I am breastfeeding.'We found that amongst mothers with infants of 3 months or younger, 94.1% said that they breastfed the previous day and 72.2% were breastfeeding predominantly and not using""]",The prevalence of predominant breastfeeding among mothers with infants of 3 months or younger is 72.2%.

23,How do pre-trained language models improve the performance of the abstractive summarization model?,"['-specific pre-trained language models, i.e., the SciBERT and BioBERT, our proposed abstractive summarization model achieves certain performance gains, which proves that in-domain pre-training corpora can help the downstream tasks. In our case, SciBERT and BioBERT improve the performance significantly as expected, since they are mainly pre-trained on the scientific papers from biomedical domain; 3) SciBERT-based model outperforms BioBERT-based model by 1.40 points on ROUGE-1, which emphasizes the necessity of a domain-specific vocabulary. Though both of two domain-specific pre-trained models are all obtained by training on the biomedical corpora and the corpus of BioBERT is much larger, the BioBERT-bases model is less competitive because it simply inherits the vocabulary from BERT.The feature fusion module learns to merge the features generated by sequence encoder and knowledge encoder. And the quality of fused representations from the feature fusion module is crucial to the summary generation process. In this set of experiments, we analyze the effectiveness of various feature fusion methods in our proposed summarization framework.As shown in Table 7 , we find that the abstractive summarization model with highway networks achieves the highest ROUGE scores, and other variations of highway networks also show satisfactory results. We propose that two learnable gates in the highway networks enable the feature fusion module to learn control the information flows, which not only eases the back propagation of gradients, but also merges the output features from sequence encoder and knowledge encoder. We are surprised to find that the abstractive summarization framework with residual networks performs poorest. We attribute it to the fact that the highway networks are more suitable for abstractive summarization task, although the residual connections usually outperform highway networks in computer vision field.A word in the sequence can connect more other words when increasing window size. To verify whether the word co-occurrence graph with more edges would lead to better abstractive summarization performance, we conduct experiments on word co-occurrence graphs with different window sizes. We construct the word cooccurrence graph using a strategy in which the same words in different positions of the sentence share their neighbors. Though this scheme allows diverse information to propagate to identical words and alleviate the polysemy problem to some extent, the number of edges surges as the window size increases because their neighbors are shared.To this end, we restrict the number of neighbors for each node in the word co-occurrence graph to five times of the corresponding window size at most. We set the window size of the word co-occurrence graph to 2, 3, 5, and 10, respectively, while settings of the other components remain default as represented in Table 2 . We run our proposed abstractive framework with Heuristic1 sentence extraction method, SciBERT encoder, and highway networks as the feature fusion module on the CORD-19 test set. Table 8 shows experimental results. As shown in Table 8 , the word co-occurrence graph with a window size of 3 achieves the best performance of abstractive summarization. We observe that the ROUGE scores increase a little when the window size has not reached 3, but the ROUGE scores drop when the window size is above 3. We attribute the above results to the over-smoothing issue, that the node representations become indistinguishable when the graph neural networks go deeper, we deem that increasing number of connections in word co-occurrence graphs might hurt the summarization performance. Thus, we can conclude that the window size of the word co-occurrence graph indirectly affects the performance of our abstractive summarization framework. The underlying insight behind this observation is that the number of connections is associated with the over-smoothing issue for graph attention networks.After hyper-parameter tuning, we find that our model with Heuris-tic1 sentence extraction method, SciBERT as sequence encoder, highway networks as feature fusion module and word co-occurrence graph with a Table 8 Our proposed framework with different window size of word-occurrence graph. window size of 3, performs best. Thus, we compare our proposed model with other methods which have been introduced in Section 4.2. Table 9 shows the performance of different summarization methods on the CORD-19 test set. The traditional extractive summarization methods, i.e., LEAD-3 and TextRank, deliver mediocre performance on all ROUGE scores. Since LEAD-3 only selects the first three sentences in source documents, the extracted summaries are too short compared to the ground-truth summary, which leads to high precisions, low recalls, and overall poor performance. The pointer-generator networks with coverage mechanism also shows unsatisfactory ROUGE scores because LSTM-based encoderdecoder frameworks are more suited for the summarization of short text.

204,What is the relationship between eating out and skin carotenoid levels in the study?,"[' if relationships between skin carotenoids and increases in consumption of fruits and vegetables as part of the parental WMP were not identified.Higher skin carotenoids were associated with lower frequency of consumption of meals prepared away from home, with significant inverse relationships identified for parents and children for fast food consumption and for children with restaurant or carry out meals at WMP initiation. These results suggest meals purchased outside the home are lower in fruits and vegetables than those prepared within the home. Previous literature also demonstrated this relationship, with away from home meals associated with poorer diet quality and lower fruit and vegetable intakes among dyads [45] . The lack of a significant relationship between skin carotenoids and meals away from home at 3-and 6-months, may indicate improvements in dietary behaviors as a result of strategies learned through parental participation in WMP.Though this study has many strengths, including longitudinal data collection, a wellestablished adult WMP, enrollment of parent-child dyads, and objective indicators of fruit and vegetable consumption and height/weight, it is not without limitations. As a single-arm study, the lack of a control group limits the ability to determine the causal effect of the WMP on outcomes. Further, the small sample size, attrition, and homogeneity of participants as well as the use of a convenience sample may limit generalizability to other populations participating in adult weight management settings. The way that fruit and vegetable consumption was measured included combined increases in ""fruit and vegetable"" intake, and did not include the preparation of these foods (i.e., raw, processed, etc.). Bioavailability of carotenoids varies based upon the food matrix, processing conditions, preparation, and several other factors, lack of information on these details in this study impedes the ability to fully elucidate mechanisms that may have impacted changes in skin carotenoids over the course of the WMP, and thus results should be interpreted with caution [46] .

200,How can healthcare professionals' behavior be influenced in COVID-19 prevention and treatment using nudging techniques?,"['Nudging healthcare professionals to improve treatment of COVID-19: a narrative review\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on healthcare systems worldwide and disrupted routine care. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) have had to quickly improvise and adapt to cope with a novel deadly virus with uncertain treatment options, lack of evidence, and a shortage of medical supply and personal protective equipment.In an ideal world, clinicians would base their decisions on scientific evidence and best practices. In practice, however, behavioural science shows that decisions are affected by emotional and cognitive biases, especially under stress. 1 2 Understanding the behavioural nature of decision-making is essential for designing processes that mitigate risks and improve the quality of care. This is particularly important because of the fast-paced developments characterising the COVID-19 pandemic.One effective strategy in improving decision-making is nudging: subtle changes to the design of the environment or framing choices without restrictions to encourage a given behaviour. 3 These strategies are often easy to scale and implement at a low cost, making nudging a practical approach to behaviour change. 4 Nudging interventions have been widely effective, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] but often patient directed, and less attention has been given to the use of behavioural insights to support HCPs in making appropriate medical decisions.In this review, we synthesise the available literature on how nudging techniques can be used to affect the behaviour of HCPs in clinical settings in order to see if these can be useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The results are intended to guide and inspire quick implementation of cost-effective solutions that can improve the quality of care.Our objective was to identify interventions using nudge theory 3 to affect the behaviour of HCPs in clinical settings, focusing on target groups, nudging techniques, delivery systems and empirical evidence.Open access intervention, including purpose, target behaviour, measured outcomes, key findings, nudging strategies used and their theoretical underpinnings. The characteristics of the nudging strategies that would allow for systematic grouping were identified. Several grouping approaches were discussed until the most appropriate grouping was selected. The studies were categorised and characterised using descriptive analysis.Nudging is often referenced to two modes of thinking: the automatic system (system 1) and the reflective system (system 2). 3 17 However, the underlying behavioural strategies that give rise to different interventions are not always described or easy to characterise. Therefore, we categorised the nudging strategies according to two practical dimensions: ► Synchronous versus asynchronous: an intervention strategy is synchronous if its delivery coincides with the decision or behaviour it intends to affect, while an asynchronous strategy can be performed anytime. For example, providing alternative options when a clinician is prescribing antibiotics in the electronic system is a synchronous strategy: alternative options (nudge) are presented when the prescription (target behaviour) is taking place. A poster providing information on sound antibiotic prescribing is an asynchronous strategy not connected to a specific prescription. ► Active versus passive: an active strategy cannot be completed without action from the targeted clinician, while a passive strategy does not require any action. For example, requesting written justifications for an antibiotic prescription to complete the order is active strategy: the prescription (target behaviour) cannot be completed without justification (nudge), while changing the default prescription is a passive strategy.The database search yielded 1436 articles (figure 1); 36 duplicates and additional 1352 articles that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria were excluded. Of the 48 articles included for full-text review, 28 were excluded because they were not relevant to COVID-19, resulting in 20 articles included in the analysis. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and five focused on encouraging judicious antibiotic prescription. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Out of the 20 studies included for analysis, seven employed more than one medium of intervention, and 13 employed only one. While seven studies delivered the intervention via electronic health records (EHRs) or electronic prescription ordering systems, nine used communication technologies such as email, text messages or traditional letters. Six studies altered the physical environment by using posters, lights or aromatisation, two made modifications to the ventilation machines and two introduced electronic dashboards. Seventeen of the 20 articles had a statistically significant positive result (online supplemental table S1). Of the three that failed, two 24 29 delivered the nudge through email and one through letter. 30 Overall, 28 different nudging strategies were identified, including accountable justifications, active choices, alerts and reminders, default settings, environmental cueing, feedback, peer comparison, goal setting, information transparency, suggested alternatives and education (online supplemental table S1). There was no standard nomenclature across articles, and many of the articles did not discuss the underlying behavioural theories that gave rise to the nudging intervention.The authors']",The available literature suggests that nudging techniques can be used to affect the behavior of healthcare professionals in clinical settings in order to improve the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.,"Healthcare professionals' behavior in COVID-19 prevention and treatment can be influenced using nudging techniques. Nudging involves making subtle changes to the design of the environment or framing choices without restrictions to encourage a specific behavior.

For example, nudging techniques can be used to improve hand hygiene, increase vaccination rates, reduce complications for intubated patients, and avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions among healthcare professionals. By using nudging strategies that are both active and passive, synchronous and asynchronous, healthcare professionals can be guided towards making appropriate medical decisions in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","How can healthcare professionals' behavior be influenced in COVID-19 prevention and treatment using nudging techniques? ->: Healthcare professionals' behavior in COVID-19 prevention and treatment can be influenced using nudging techniques.

81,How does exercise affect the immune system in patients with chronic diseases and infections?,"[' to training.When 2 groups of trained and untrained mice were infected in a resting period with Salmonella typhimurium [62] or influenza type A, [63] the trained mice had a higher survival rate than sedentary mice. In contrast, when mice performed intense exercise during the incubation period of an infection with Coxsackie B virus, increased tissue destruction and mortality were found among the exercising animals. [64] Also, several studies in humans have explored the relationship between exercise and URTI. These are summarised in a recent review by Nieman.[l] These studies were based on self-report and did not include a clinical examination or laboratory workup. An increased frequency of URTI has been reported in a study of 1550 runners who took part in a 56km race, compared with matched controls. Those who ran faster race times reported more symptoms, indicating a dose-response relationship. [65] Nieman et a]J66] reported that the runners who actually ran a marathon reported more symptoms of URTI during the week following the race than similarly experienced runners who entered but did not participate in the race for reasons other than sickness. Heath et aP67] followed a cohort of 530 runners. Those who ran less than 16km (lO miles) per day, had the lowest odds ratio for respiratory disease, while the odds ratio more than doubled for those running more than 27km (17 miles).The effects of moderate exercise training were examined in a i5-week study of mildly obese women who were randomly assigned to a walking or a nonexercising group. The women in the exercise group experienced fewer URTI symptoms than their sedentary controls. [ 60 1 On the basis of several reports, including the above mentioned studies, a \'1\' -shaped model of the relationship between varying amounts of exercise and the risk of URTI has been suggested.[I] This model suggests that moderate exercise may lower the risk of respiratory infection while excessive amounts may increase the risk.NK cells are very sensitive to exercise, and these cells are thought to play a role in defence against malignant cells. Hoffman-Goetz [68] has recently reviewed evidence linking exercise, natural immunity and tumour metastasis. In general, there is an inverse relationship between exercise and the development of experimental tumours in ani-malsp·S81 and epidemiological evidence in humans generally supports this relationship.l69] The prevalence rates of cancers of the reproductive system (uterus, ovary, cervix and vagina) and breast cancer were determined for 5398 living alumnae, 2622 of whom were former college athletes. For nonathletes/athletes, the relative risk was 2.53 for cancers of the reproductive system and 1.83 for breast cancer. [70] The latter finding was confirmed in a recent study.l71] The association between physical job activity and colon cancer was examined in a 19-year follow-up study of 1.1 million Swedish men.l72] The relative risk of colon cancer in men employed in sedentary occupations was estimated at 1.3. However, in these epidemiological studies the possibility of exercise-induced changes in the immune system as underlying mechanisms was not addressed.In a recent study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis performed an 8-week bicycle exercise programme (30 min interval training, 4 to 5 times a week). No changes were observed in NK cell activity, BMNC proliferation or cytokinesP3] In rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis, exercise did not influence the severity of the disease.f 74 ]Infection with the HIY type 1 results in progressive and profound immunosuppression. The primary defect is the depletion of CD4+ cells, but depletions and defects in the function of other lymphocyte subpopulations, including NK and LAK cells, and altered cytokine production also occurS. [75] [76] [77] [78] HIY seropositive individuals have been shown to possess an impaired ability to mobilise neutrophils, NK cells and LAK cells to the blood in response to short term time-limited exercise stress (bicycling at 75% of V""02max for I hour).l34] The mechanisms behind this impaired recruitment are unknown, but may be attributed to an altered response to stress, a lower expression of ~-receptors on the surface of NK cells and/or a smaller reservoir of cells available for recruitment.Thus, in patients with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and HIY-infection, there have not been reports showing that exercise is harmful to the immune system or worsens disease activity.At rest, trained subjects have slightly elevated nonspecific immunity. During exercise, Ieucocytes are recruited to the blood and if muscle damage occurs the cytokine level is enhanced. Thus, short term, time-limited exercise stress induces an inflammatory response. Following long term, intense exercise the number of lymphocytes in', ""How Physical Exercise Influences the Establishment of Infections\nDuring exercise, leucocytes are recruited to the blood, and if muscle damage occurs the cytokine level is enhanced. After prolonged, intense exercise the number of lymphocytes in the blood is reduced, and the function of natural killer cells is suppressed; furthermore, secretory immunity is impaired. During this time of immunodepression, often referred to as 'the open window' , the host may be more susceptible to micro-organisms bypassing the first line of defence. This is of interest to top athletes who perform frequent severe exercise. Clinical observations regarding an increased risk of infections in top athletes are compatible with this model. However, in those performing regular moderate exercise the immune system will often be temporarily enhanced and this will protect these individuals from infections.During the past few years there has been a growing interest in understanding how exercise influences the immune system. Research into exercise immunology has been stimulated by: (a) reports of increased frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) among athletes;[l] (b) the finding that in addition to physical exercise several other physical stressors (e.g. surgery, trauma, burn, hypoxia and hyperthermia) induce changes in the cellular immune system; [2] and (c) the possibility that increased levels of some neuroendocrine factors (e.g. catecholamines and growth hormone) may modulate the immune response.f3] This article summarises some of the important findings on exercise and the first line defence mechanisms of the immune system.It is well known that exercise alters the distribution and trafficking of peripheral mononuclear cells.l 4 ] The first English-language publication reporting exercise-induced leucocytosis was by Larrabee in 1902, [5] who described the phenomenon in a small group of marathon runners. Peripheral blood leucocytosis after exercise has been shown to be due to increased concentrations of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. The neutrophil concentration increases during and after exercise.l 4 ,6] During exercise, natural killer (NK), Band T cells are also recruited to the blood, resulting in an elevated total lymphocyte count. The subpopulation composition of T cells is altered, with the CD4+/CD8+ ratio decreasing because the number of CD8+ T cells increases more than the number of CD4+ cells, After intense exercise, the lymphocyte level decreases below pre-exercise values, and the duration of this suppression depends on the intensity and duration of exercise,l3]NK cells are a heterogeneous population of cells that mediate the killing of a broad range of target cellsP] They are thought to play an important role in the first line of defence against acute and chronic viral infections and tumour spread. [8] The modulation of NK cell activity in response to exercise has been investigated extensively.[9-36] During physical exercise, the absolute concentration and the relative fraction of blood mononuclear cells (BMNC) expressing characteristic NK cell markers are markedly enhanced. Simultaneously, the cytotoxic activity of NK cells (the function of NK cells) increases. After intense exercise, NK cell activity is suppressed.l 9 -36 ] Among several hypotheses regarding the mechanism behind the postexercise suppression of NK cell activity, one has addressed the possibility that the activity is suppressed by prostaglandins released by the elevated number of monocytes,l29,32]The secretory immune system of mucosal tissues such as the upper respiratory tract is considered to be the first barrier to colonisation by pathogenic micro-organisms which might cause URTI.l37,38] In mucosal secretions immunoglobulin (Ig) A is the major class of immunoglobulins, and the level of IgA in mucosal fluids has been shown to correlate more closely with resistance to URTI than serum antibodies. [39] Tomasi et a1. [40] reported suppressed levels of salivary IgA in cross-country skiers after a race. This finding was confirmed by a 70% decrease in salivary IgA for several hours after 2 hours of intense ergometer cycling.[41] Decreased salivary IgA was found after swimming,[42] and salivary IgA was low for several hours after marathon running.l 43 ] In order to study the mechanism behind the suppression of immunoglobulins, a plaque forming cell (PFC) assay was used. This assay allows the identification of the individual immunoglobulin-secreting cells of blood. Stimulation of cells, in vitro, with pokeweed mitogen (PWM), interleukin (IL)-2 or Epstein-Barr virus (EBY) resulted in significantly decreased numbers of IgG-, IgA-and IgM-secreting blood cells both during and 2 hours after exercise, with recovery after 1 day.144] Purified B cells produce plaques only""]","In patients with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and HIY-infection, there have not been reports showing that exercise is harmful to the immune system or worsens disease activity.","In patients with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and HIY-infection, there have not been reports showing that exercise is harmful to the immune system or worsens disease activity.

Exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on the immune system in patients with chronic diseases and infections. Regular exercise can help to boost the immune system by increasing the production of white blood cells, such as T-cells and B-cells, which are important for fighting off infections. Exercise can also help to reduce inflammation, which can impair the immune system's function. Additionally"
39,What evidence of medicinal practices has been found from the Bronze Age?,"["" and the use of plants as medicine. Six papyri from Egypt, dating to between 2000 BC and 1500 BC (Frey 1985) , display an extensive knowledge with around 160 different medicinal plants identified (Ritner 2000) . Hundreds of thousands of medical texts from Mesopotamia were written mostly on clay tablets in cuneiform and date to the 3rd millennium BC (Robson 2008; Retief and Cilliers 2007) . Medicinal plants are discussed in the Atharvaveda (Bloomfield 1899), an Indian text written around 1200 BC in Sanskrit. The first known Chinese medicine text is the Huangdi Neijing dated to the third century BC (Cavalieri and Rotoli 1997) though Chinese medicine is considered to be at least 4500 years old (Wong and Wu 1932) while the earliest text in Japan is the Ishimpō, a 30-volume text completed in 984 CE (Tamba 1986 ). Early Greek medicine was strongly focused on medicinal plants (Prioreschi 1996) . De Materia Medica, a fivevolume work comprising descriptions of over 600 medicinal plants was written between 50 and 70 CE by Pedanius Dioscorides, a Greek physician in the Roman Army, while the Hippocratic Oath which dates to around 275 CE is still used today (Hulkower 2016) . Medicinal plants, specifically those with anthelmintic or anti-parasite properties, have been identified in several colonial manuscripts including the XVI century Aztec herbal, The Badianus Manuscript (Emmart 1940) . Several of these plants were tested and many were found to correlate with the curative properties described by the Aztec informants (Ortiz de Montellano 1975).Poisons are also likely to have been used in the deep past. Several plants from the Paleolithic assemblages analyzed by Hardy (2019) were poisonous as well as medicinally valuable (Fig. 4) , though it is not possible to determine whether they were used as poisons, medicines, or both since the difference is based on the dosage (Stark 2017) , something that cannot be reproduced from archeological contexts. The only way to identify the probable use of a plant as poison, rather than medicine, is by its context. Traces of Ricinus communis L., Euphorbiaceae (castor oil plant), were detected on a wooden stick similar to those used recently by the Kalahari San as poisons applicators, at the 24.5 ka archeological site of Border Cave in South Africa strongly suggesting it was being used as a poison (d'Errico et al. 2012 ) while traces of Euphorbia tirucalli L, Euphorbiaceae, another poisonous plant, were also found at the site (Borgia 2019). This plant is well known to contain irritant, cytotoxic, and tumorpromoting constituents such as phorbol ester derivatives found in the latex as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (8). The arrowheads and spear points that were developed by ancient modern humans appear in the archeological record from around 70,000-50,000 years ago. They suggest throwing weapons, enabling hunters to kill without being in direct contact with the animal; however, the stone tips were not strong or large enough to kill most animals and poison is likely to have been applied to the stone tips (Borgia 2019).The use of psychotropic plants rich in entheogens or psychoactive substances may have developed out of the evolutionary use of medicinal plants since the physiological pathways to process these compounds are the same as those used for medicinal plants. These pathways are likely to be very ancient and combine taste receptors, tissue barriers, and the bloodbrain barrier (Sullivan and Hagen 2002; Hagen and Tushingham 2019) . However, archeological evidence for psychotropic drug use in the Paleolithic is limited. Currently the earliest potential evidence comes from a 13,000-year-old site in Timor where the remains of betel vine (Areca catechu L., Arecaceae) were found (Hagen and Tushingham 2019) . Redbrown-stained teeth, also demonstrating the use of betel nut, were recovered from sites in the Philippines and Vietnam dated to the 3rd millennium BC (Bronze Age) (Guerra-Doce 2015). The evidence for psychoactive plant use is more abundant in the Neolithic and also the Egyptian New Kingdom (Merlin 2003) with evidence in the form of carbonized remains of the actual plants and also as residual traces inside ceramic pots and impressions in the clay or, in Egypt, also displayed on artifacts (Merlin 2003) . The presence of Cannabis has been identified as hemp imprints on pottery from Taiwan (10,000 years BP) and is present as a raw material (hemp) in early farming contexts in China (Guerra-Doce 2015) but the most common plant is Papaver somniferum L.,"", ' from 6 to 33%, rising significantly at the start of the Neolithic period 11-9000 years ago, suggests more extensive mechanisms for social transmission at this time (Fig. 4) .After the Paleolithic, there is more evidence of both survival with pathologies and, in some exceptional cases, actual remains of medicinal plants. The mummified body of a 4500-year-old man, thought to be around 40-50 years old when he died, was found in 1991 in the Italian Alps (Gaber and Künzel 1998) . Nicknamed Ötzi, he had multiple pathologies, including periodontitis, healed rib fractures, intestinal parasites, and gall stones. He also had some degenerative joint disease, mild osteoarthritis, and a healed broken rib as well as several peri-mortem injuries (Zink et al. 2019 ). Sixty-one tattoos in nineteen groups were found on his body (Samadelli et al. 2015) , all related to known acupuncture points suggesting preventative medicinal measures, while fragments of plants, including the bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, Dennstaedtiaceae (treatment: intestinal parasites), several mosses including Sphagnum imbricatum Hornsch. ex Russow., Sphagnaceae (treatment: wound dressing) and fungi like birch polypore, Piptoporus betulinus (Bull.) P. Karst., Fomitopsidaceae (anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties) were found either as part of his equipment or in his stomach and are thought to have been used as medicines (Zink et al. 2019 ). The very detailed study of this mummified individual has provided a unique insight into the extent of both preventative and curative medicine from the Bronze Age (Fig. 5) .One of the earliest sites in the American continent is Monte Verde, in Chile, that was occupied from at least 18,500-14,500 years ago (Dillehay et al. 2015) . This site has a large assemblage of carbonized plants, of which a significant number, including several species of seaweed, are thought to have been collected for their medicinal properties while the remains of a structure are thought to be a medicinal hut (Dillehay 1997 , Dillehay et al. 2008 , Dillehay et al. 2015 . Traces of the medicinal San Pedro cactus, Echinopsis pachanoi (Britton & Rose) Friedrich & G.D. Rowley, Cactaceae, were found at Guitarrero Cave, Peru, and dated to around 10,000 years ago (8600-5600 BC; Lynch 1980) . Medicinal uses including treatment for ulcers, wounds, inflammation acne, and fortifying hair have been recorded ethnographically (Bussmann and Sharon 2006; Paniagua-Zambrana and Bussmann 2020) , and it also has hallucinogenic properties (Guerra-Doce 2015) due to its high content of mescaline (7), a protoalkaloid of the substituted phenethylamine class. Reinhard et al. (1991) developed the use of pollen extracted from human coprolites to develop studies of paleopharmacology from North and South American archeological sites. The use of pollen as evidence of deliberate plant ingestion is complex, since it occurs as ""rain"" and can be environmental; however, high concentrations are suggested to indicate intentional consumption (Reinhard et al. 1991) . Using this method, several studies of prehistoric and pre-Hispanic populations in the American continent have identified possible ingestion of a range of medicinal plants, sometimes in association with evidence for intestinal parasites. Examples include sites in North America (Reinhard et al. 1991 ) (Ephedra sp., Larrea sp., Salix sp.; Sobolik and Gerick 1992, Ephedra sp., Prosopis sp.), and South America, including Furna do Estrago, Pernambuco State, Brazil (several plants including Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart.) Coville, Fabaceae, or barbatimão) and a range of genera including, Sida sp., Sebastiania sp., and Fevillea sp. (Teixeira-Santos et al. 2015) and Pedra Furada, in the State of Piauí, Brazil, where twelve taxa from genera that include medicinal plants were identified (de Miranda Chaves and Reinhard 2006) . The low levels of the otherwise very common intestinal parasites Ascaris lumbricoides (giant roundworm) and Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) in some South American prehistoric populations have led to the suggestion that this may be due to the use of medicinal plants (Leles et al. 2010) .Some of the earliest texts known concern medical practices']","The mummified body of a 4500-year-old man, thought to be around 40-50 years old when he died, was found in 1991 in the Italian Alps.

The earliest evidence of medicinal practices during the Bronze Age has been found in the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China.

47,What is the relationship between skin carotenoids and consumption of fruits and vegetables in the study?,"[' if relationships between skin carotenoids and increases in consumption of fruits and vegetables as part of the parental WMP were not identified.Higher skin carotenoids were associated with lower frequency of consumption of meals prepared away from home, with significant inverse relationships identified for parents and children for fast food consumption and for children with restaurant or carry out meals at WMP initiation. These results suggest meals purchased outside the home are lower in fruits and vegetables than those prepared within the home. Previous literature also demonstrated this relationship, with away from home meals associated with poorer diet quality and lower fruit and vegetable intakes among dyads [45] . The lack of a significant relationship between skin carotenoids and meals away from home at 3-and 6-months, may indicate improvements in dietary behaviors as a result of strategies learned through parental participation in WMP.Though this study has many strengths, including longitudinal data collection, a wellestablished adult WMP, enrollment of parent-child dyads, and objective indicators of fruit and vegetable consumption and height/weight, it is not without limitations. As a single-arm study, the lack of a control group limits the ability to determine the causal effect of the WMP on outcomes. Further, the small sample size, attrition, and homogeneity of participants as well as the use of a convenience sample may limit generalizability to other populations participating in adult weight management settings. The way that fruit and vegetable consumption was measured included combined increases in ""fruit and vegetable"" intake, and did not include the preparation of these foods (i.e., raw, processed, etc.). Bioavailability of carotenoids varies based upon the food matrix, processing conditions, preparation, and several other factors, lack of information on these details in this study impedes the ability to fully elucidate mechanisms that may have impacted changes in skin carotenoids over the course of the WMP, and thus results should be interpreted with caution [46] . Finally, future work would benefit from including assessments of 24-h food recalls or food frequency questionnaires to confer with parental and child skin carotenoids.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/ 10.3390/nu13072227/s1, Table S1 : Correlation Matrix between Child and Parent Weight Status and Skin Carotenoids at Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months.

94,Where is the recombination breakpoint in the bovine Norovirus strain B4881 capsid coding sequence?,"['en and hindgut of cattle and sheep (Nathan et al., 2015) .Positive samples for bovine Norovirus were identified as Bo/AR/ 2012/B4836 (B4836), Bo/AR/2012/B4848 (B4848) and Bo/AR/2012/ B4881 (B4881). These three samples came from young calves with diarrhea from different provinces of Argentina. Sample B4836 was collected from a 9-day-old calf from a dairy herd in Santa Fe province. Sample B4848 came from a 2-day-old calf from Buenos Aires province and B4881 was taken from a 3-day-old animal from Córdoba province. All Norovirus positive samples were collected in 2012. Using the BLAST tool, the three partial sequences obtained from RdRp gene showed to be genetically most closely related to GIII bovine Norovirus sequences. The sequence of B4848 was most closely related with GIII.1 viruses, whereas both B4836 and B4881 were most closely related to GIII.2 viruses (Fig. 1A) . Considering the fact that recombination commonly occurs at the ORF1-ORF2 junction, we attempted to get the complete VP1 coding sequences by next generation sequencing, which was successful for the B4848 and B4881 strains. By phylogenetic analyses, these two sequences were more closely related to GIII.1 viruses (Fig. 1B) . This indicates contradictory phylogenetic inferences for B4881, grouping the polymerase (ORF1, RdRp) and capsid regions (ORF2, VP1) of this strain into different genotypes, which may suggest recombination between the RdRp and VP1 coding regions at the genotype level.In order to clarify if strain B4881 could be a recombinant genotype, a nucleotide identity plot -Simplotanalysis was performed on the sequence encompassing the end of the RdRp gene (ORF1, 3′ region, 498 nt), and both the entire ORF2 and ORF3 regions. For this analysis both reference strains for genotypes GIII.1 (GIII.1 Jena) and GIII.2 (GIII.2 Newbury2) were included. For ORF1, the percentage of nucleotide identity between B4881 and GIII.1 Jena was between 83% and 91%, while the similarity to GIII.2 Newbury2 was between 63% and 82% (Fig. 2) . However, Fig. 2 shows a putative recombination breakpoint located within the ORF1/ORF2 overlap, from where B4881 nucleotide sequence seems to be more similar to GIII.2 Newbury2 sequence than to GIII.1 Jena. Furthermore, for the ORF2/3 region, the similarity between B4881 and both GIII.1 Jena and GIII.2 Newbury2 strains is particularly low, especially in the more variable region of the capsid coding sequence (P domain). These results suggest that B4881 sequence could be a representative of a potential new genotype within GIII, tentatively named GIII.4.To further explore the positions of the amino acid changes observed in B4848 and B4881, their VP1 sequences were compared to reference strain GIII.1 Jena, using three-dimensional modeling (Fig. 3) . Because VP1 is the major capsid protein, it is important to evaluate if the amino acid changes are mainly in the P domain or the S domain, especially because the P domain has both cell receptor ligand and immunogenic determinant activities. As expected, B4881 showed a higher number of modifications than B4848 compared to GIII.1 Jena reference sequence. It seems also clear that most of the amino acid changes observed in B4881 are located at the P domain. The circulation of bovine Noroviruses has been poorly studied in South America, with only a single report of a partial RdRp sequences from bovine enteric caliciviruses in Venezuela (Alcala et al., 2003) . In the present work, a screening was conducted aiming at the detection of Norovirus in Argentinean cattle herds belonging to the main dairy regions of the country. Both genotype GIII.1-and GIII.2-related sequences were found to circulate in Argentinean dairy calves. Moreover, according to the genetic analyses, one of the sequences (B4881) may also constitute a potential new genotype in the bovine Norovirus GIII, tentatively named GIII.4.The detection rate of Norovirus reported in this study (3.3%) is in agreement with studies in Belgium (7.5%, 10 out of 133 fecal samples using a CBECu-F/R primer set)']",The recombination breakpoint in the bovine Norovirus strain B4881 capsid coding sequence is located within the ORF1/ORF2 overlap.,"The recombination breakpoint in the bovine Norovirus strain B4881 capsid coding sequence is located within the ORF1/ORF2 overlap.

227,"Which power line component has been overlooked in previous vision-based inspection studies, despite its role in preventing loosening and falling?","["" two main optimization criteria are the accuracy of the prediction and the time inferred to obtain the solution ever more tailored solutions building on CNNs are being developed recently. Architectures such as VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) and ResNet (He et al. 2015a) for image classification and Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) and SSD (Liu et al. 2016 ) for object detection have proven to provide good accuracy at resonable inference time.CV is utilized for infrastructure inspection in many application domains. The typical challenges addressed with CV in this area are cases where large amounts of physical objects are to be inspected and they are geographically remote and / or dispersed. Selected research articles are presented in the following and summarized in Table 1. A major application area is road surface inspection and maintenance. Roads in bad condition can ultimately result in more accidents and higher costs (Baladi et al. 2017; Gleave et al. 2014) . Thus, CV is utilized to automatically assess road surface condition and derive necessary maintenance actions. Over the last years this became possible without expensive, specialized hardware (compare, e.g., Quintana et al. 2016) . Chatterjee et al. (2018) show how machine learning-based CV can be used to detect road surface cracks and develop a ''vision-based DSS for crack detection''. They offer first insights into a nascent design theory for the application case of road crack detection on the basis of images.Not only roads, but also railways need to be inspected periodically to ensure safe transports. Wei et al. (2019) employ a Faster R-CNN to detect defects of railway track fasteners. Gibert et al. (2017) propose a CNN-based multitask learning approach that detects railway track fasteners and crossties and classifies the state of these components.Wind turbine blades are another physical object of interest for CV-based infrastructure inspection. Akhloufi and Benmesbah (2014) present a CV approach to identify ice accreation on wind turbine blades. Ice accreation can require a maintenance action since it can cause malfunction and premature wear and is a safety hazard for nearby people and infrastructure like roads and powerlines. Shihavuddin et al. (2019) show how faults like leading edge erosion can be detected with a Faster R-CNN on wind turbine blades.In this work, we are particularly interested in CV solutions for power line inspection relying on UAV images. From a component-based view, power line inspection can be divided into four major categories: towers or poles, insulators, conductors, and fittings (Liu et al. 2020) . Each of these categories contains several subcomponents (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) that typically vary in size, kind, and material according to the voltage level. For instance, some part of a distribution network with low voltage might have wooden poles, small standing insulators, and a single, relatively thin conductor. On the other hand, transmission networks usually have lattice steel towers, large suspending insulators, and thicker conductors. Several studies have been published that utilize various potential platforms (e.g., helicopter, satellite, and UAV) to collect different data types (e.g., optical images, laser scanner data, thermal images, and synthetic aperture radar images) and analyzed these (Matikainen et al. 2016) . The vision-based approach -with image data from the visible spectrum captured by UAVs and automatically analyzed through image processing capabilities -has gained the most attention and traction in the power line inspection research domain (Liu et al. 2020) . With a few exceptions, automated vision-based power line inspection based on UAV-captured images requires two inherently related tasks (Liu et al. 2020) : component detection and localization as well as fault diagnosis. The exceptions relate to objects such as bird nests, whose detection already represents a fault. Previous research applying image processing for the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs is numerous (Mirallès et al. 2014) . Liu et al. (2020) identify several characteristics and shortcomings of previous studies using UAV-captured images in their exhaustive literature review. Most studies in the field of vision-based inspection of power lines focus on the insulator and its faults (Liu et al. 2020 ) -mainly missing caps (e.g., Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019; Zhai et al. 2018 ) -while little attention has been paid to other components. The safety pin that prevents other components from loosening and falling is the smallest object in the power line and has, despite its importance, received little attention and has only been regarded in fault diagnosis but not in the detection step. Finally, both Liu et al. (2020) and Nguyen et al. (2018) conclude that the mediocre performance of task-specific approaches presented in the vast majority of studies has been superseded by DL approaches that have improved""]","The safety pin has been overlooked in previous vision-based inspection studies, despite its role in preventing loosening and falling.","The safety pin has been overlooked in previous vision-based inspection studies, despite its role in preventing other components from loosening and falling.","Which power line component has been overlooked in previous vision-based inspection studies, despite its role in preventing loosening and falling? ->: The safety pin has been overlooked in previous vision-based inspection studies, despite its role in preventing other components from loosening and falling.","The power line component that has been overlooked in previous vision-based inspection studies despite its role in preventing loosening and falling is the ""sleeve.""

43,What is the advantage of using the ConA-ELISA system in the indirect immunoperoxidase test?,"[' indirect immunoperoxidase test to visualize specific reactivity [25] . Having the advantage that already staining pattern in this test may give an indication whether MAbs are directed to outer glycoproteins, the test depends on manual inspection of the plates and is more difficult to standardize; in addition, use of formalin may denature sensitive epitopes. To be able to use ELISA technique for high throughput screening, investigators have used antibody-or poly L-lysine-coated plates to capture and thereby preserve the conformation of a viral protein [56, 57] . Our test system relied on the lectin properties of ConA as an anchor for the antigen, a system previously shown to preserve conformational epitopes of viral glycoproteins [42, 43] . By using a genotype 2.VI specific monoclonal antibody that is highly reactive by HI [46] , we could demonstrate that the ConA-ELISA preserves NDV epitopes sensitive to receptor blocking. Applying the Con-A-ELISA for screening of the initial hybridoma supernatants and subsequent cloning, we obtained six MAb that were reactive by ELISA and HI, and all six clones could be confirmed by IFT. However, none of the six HI-positive MAb were reactive by WB, which is in line with previous studies that denaturing WB conditions destroyed the conformation of HI sensitive epitopes of the HN molecule. Overall, comparing ELISA reactivity to HI titers, it became apparent that ConA-ELISA was far more sensitive producing titers of well above 1:3200, whereas the highest HI titer was 1:256 (8 log 2 ) but without a direct correlation between the two values. It is striking that the MAb with the lowest HI titer (5C2) had comparable or even higher ELISA reactivity than the other MAbs. The ConA-ELISA, in addition, was able to present strain specific epitopes, as five out of six HI-positive MAbs reacted only with NDV genotype 2.VII strain NR730 but not with the vaccine strain clone 30, genotype 2.II, by HI. Thus, using HN-enriched virus preparation in conjunction with ConA-ELISA system that preserves conformational epitopes proved to be efficient to produce specific MAbs that are suitable to identify biologically relevant targets in specific NDV genotypes.In order to investigate the putative conservation of HIsensitive epitopes of HN proteins of ND viruses of different genotypes we extended the analysis to cross-reactivity using NDV strains representing distantly related class 1 NDV as well as seven additional class 2 genotype viruses. Only MAb 4E11 was reactive with all 8 different NDV genotypes tested, including the class 1 strain. On the other hand, the majority of HN specific MAbs predominantly reacted with the homologous NDV strain NR730, although within this group of MAbs three distinct reactivity profiles were discernable: (a) MAb 5C2 showed residual cross-reactivity to three other genotypes, (b) three MAbs (5C9, 5D1, 7C12) reacted specifically with two different genotype 2.VII strains, and (c) MAb 7A8 differentiated between the two genotype 2.VII viruses. This points, in summary, to a high degree of flexibility of some HI epitopes, whereas other epitopes seem to be very well preserved. This is corroborated by observations derived from structural analysis of the HN molecule: Crenell and colleagues found that MAbs could interfere with receptor binding, even though the target was not the receptor binding pocket itself [52] . In consequence such sites might not be crucial for the function of the molecule and are allowed to have more structural flexibility. Intrinsic properties of antibodies targeting these sites might then influence the specificity of the reaction, i.e. antibodies with high affinity might be able to bind a broader spectrum of virus strains. On the other hand, epitopes adjacent to or directly at the receptor binding site are part of functionally pivotal structures and have to stay conserved. These epitopes would represent conserved antigenic sites across the genotypes as recognized by the MAb 4E11 which showed HI and neutralization activity. In the viral HN antigen used for immunizing the mice, both types of sites were apparently immunogenic. Considering the number of obtained MAb, i.e. five strain specific versus one MAb specific for a conserved site, the variable sites might have been more immunogenic for mice. In contrast, polyclonal antibody preparations revealed only minor antigenic differences, indicating a balanced presentation of conserved and strain-/genotype-specific antigenic sites for chickens. In consequence polyclonal sera are of limited value when addressing variability of antigenic sites. On the other hand, polyclonal sera raised after immunization of chickens are capable']",The advantage of using the ConA-ELISA system in the indirect immunoperoxidase test is that it preserves conformational epitopes of viral glycoproteins.,"The advantage of using the ConA-ELISA system in the indirect immunoperoxidase test is that it is suitable for detecting antibodies to conformational epitopes within the HN protein of NDV.

145,"What is the connection between lung tumor progression, malignant pleural effusion, IL-1β, and the C5a-C5aR axis?","[' conclusion, showing that the IL-1β/IL-1R axis regulates the apoptosis of A549 cells (Figure 6(d) ,(e)). Although IL-1β is responsible for migration/invasion and has been shown to be produced by cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as macrophages, fibroblasts, and B-cells, 33 the mechanism by which IL-1β induces the formation of MPE by shaping the metastasis of tumor cells in the pleural cavity is poorly understood. As shown in Figure 6 (f)-(i), IL-1β promoted cancer cell migration, invasion and adhesion. Moreover, our data in Figure 6 (j) showed that the IL-1β/IL-1R axis may have a regulatory role in the EMT of A549 cells, which exerts a similar effect on colon cancer cells. 43 In general, our data showed that IL-1β facilitated the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of A549 cells, attenuated the apoptosis of tumor cells, and provided clues for the combination of chemotherapy and IL-1β blockade to improve the outcomes of patients with lung cancer.In conclusion, our data suggested that the numbers of intermediate monocytes in MPE were significantly increased compared with their compartments in blood and that overrepresentation of intermediate monocytes in MPE may be due to the PMC-produced CCL2 promoted by C5a. Our data also revealed the activation of the classical and alternative pathways of complement in MPE and the initial role of C5a in MPE. Therefore, the estimations of monocyte subsets and complement components might be novel candidate markers for distinguishing different pleural effusions. Further investigation showed that the C5a-C5aR axis between pleural mesothelial cells and intermediate monocytes in MPE was responsible for the overexpression of IL-1β by intermediate monocytes, which could represent an immunological pathogenic mechanism of malignant pleural effusion. Hence, blocking C5a-C5aR axis by antagonists alleviated the IL-1β inflammatory in monocytes, further reducing the formation of malignant pleural effusion. Moreover, C5a and IL-1β significantly increased the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of tumor cells and inhibited apoptosis in vitro. These data add to the emerging role of complement components activated by intermediate monocytes in lung tumor progression and metastasis and raise the possibility that C5a contributes to a tumorassociated microenvironment that fosters tumor cell aggressiveness.', ' et al. reported that blockade of the C5a-C5aR1 axis resulted in a substantial improvement in the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies against lung cancer growth and metastasis through CXCL16-mediated effects. 29 We demonstrated high expression of CCL2 but no difference in CCL7 or CX3CL1 expression in MPE compared with transudate plural effusion (Figure 3 Compared with other monocyte subsets, intermediate monocytes in humans express higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, 30, 31 which promotes the progression of tumors. 32 However, the role of cytokines released by intermediate monocytes in MPE needs to be further elucidated. Our data showed a significant increase in IL-1β expression in MPE supernatant and a higher level of IL-1β secretion in intermediate monocytes isolated from MPE (Figure 4(a),(b) ). Consistent with a previous in vitro study in neutrophils, 33 our data showed that C5a has the potential to induce the generation of LPS-stimulated IL-1β in intermediate monocytes (Figure 4(c) , (d)). Collectively, our results demonstrated that the C5a-C5aR axis not only regulates the infiltration of intermediate monocytes into the pleural cavity, but also increases the proportion of IL-1β-releasing intermediate monocytes, which participate in the immune response in MPE.Although C5a has been reported to be an essential mediator of inflammation-induced tumorigenesis, little information is known about its role in the progression of tumor cells. 17 We found that C5a induced A549 cell proliferation in lung cancer, which was consistent with the findings of Chen et al. 20 Chen et al. also proved that the C5a-C5aR pathway participates in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer via activation of the PI3K/AKT axis. 19 Similarly, our results showed that C5a treatment led to a highly significant increase in the levels of p-AKT. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor LY29f4002 was reported to inhibit A549 proliferation in the presence of C5a ( Figure 5(d) ,(e)). Thus, it is plausible to suggest that C5a-C5aR signaling regulates the proliferation of lung carcinoma cells via PI3K/AKT axis activation. Some reports have indicated that the C5a-C5aR axis decreases apoptosis in several cell types, such as neutrophils, 34 T cells, 35 and macrophages. 36 Our current study suggested that the C5a-C5aR axis could protect lung cancer cells from DDP-induced apoptosis ( Figure 5 (h),(i)). The migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of tumor cells are also important factors influencing tumor metastasis. Our data revealed that C5a facilitated the migration and invasion of lung carcinoma cells ( Figure 5 (j),(k)). Additionally, C5a was reported to promote the intercellular adhesion of A549 cells to PMCs ( Figure 5 (l),(m)), consistent with previous studies, which proved that C5a was the principal initiator of neutrophil adhesion by regulating cell adhesion molecules. 37 Furthermore, the C5a axis showed a similar role in promoting EMT in A549 cells ( Figure 5 (n)) as it did in renal tubular epithelial cells. 38 Overall, our study revealed that C5a exerted a tumor-promoting effect by inducing the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of A549 cells and inhibiting the apoptosis of tumor cells, while C5aRA significantly reversed these effects.IL-1β has emerged as a key component of tumorpromoting inflammation by shaping different elements of the tumor microenvironment, including cancer cell proliferation, 32,39 migration, and metastasis. 32, 40 Based on our data showing that C5a has the ability to induce IL-1β secretion from intermediate monocytes, we attempted to explore the role of IL-1β overexpression stimulated by C5a. Here, we demonstrated that the IL-1β/IL-1R axis could promote the proliferation of A549 cells in vitro (Figure 6(a) , (b)), which was consistent with previous studies on human natural killer cells and glioblastoma cells. 41 We also found a tendency towards the upregulation of MAPK/p-MAPK expression in A549 cells after IL-1β treatment (Figure 6(c) ), but further study is needed to confirm whether the MAPK signaling pathway is the main mechanism by which IL-1β induces the growth of tumor cells. According to previous studies, the IL-1β/IL-1R axis is also a regulator of apoptosis in several cell types. 42 Our study reached a similar']","The connection between lung tumor progression, malignant pleural effusion, IL-1β, and the C5a-C5aR axis is that IL-1β facilitates the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of A549 cells, attenuates the apoptosis of tumor cells, and contributes to the formation of malignant pleural effusion.

This inflammatory response can contribute to the development of malignant pleural effusion by enhancing cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, C5a can protect lung cancer cells from apoptosis and promote their aggressiveness.

3,What is the role of the antiviral response in the immune system?,"['-15 is involved in natural killer cell differentiation as part of an antiviral response (55) . Meanwhile, CCL5 mediates eosinophil infiltration which is considered to be involved in the recovery after SARS-CoV infection (56) . Clusters II and V contain cytokines measured only in H7N9 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, whereas TGF-β1 was measured only in SARS-CoV studies in cluster IV.Both type-I and type-II IFNs play an instrumental role in the immune response to viral infection.Our analysis indicates that early induction of type-I IFNs occurs upon H5N1 and H7N9 influenza A infection as well as upon the β-coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (21, 34, 57) . However, type-I IFN response is only weakly elicited following a SARS-CoV-2 infection, if at all (37, 58) .Infection with either of the two influenza subtypes seems to increase the levels of measured type-I IFN-relevant cytokines, resulting in an antiviral immune response, with the appropriate cytokines showing elevated levels in all influenza A studies (Figure 4, Supplementary Table 1) .The β-coronavirus-mediated responses show a much more variable IFN response: with SARS-CoV, we see that the type-I IFN response is active, including the downstream-activated IL-12 that reflects the involvement of mature dendritic cells. IL-12 also indirectly activates IFN-γ further downstream. IL-10 is not elevated, which potentially prevents the downregulation of the type-I IFN response.In MERS-CoV infections, the type-I IFN response is induced, but not in all cases (59) . In some studies, the levels of IL-12 do not increase, in agreement with IFN-γ also staying at low levels. Yet, we see the involvement of the (mostly) anti-inflammatory IL-10. However, caution needs to be applied when looking at IL-10 in an inflammation context, as more and more clinical evidence suggests that this cytokine displays pro-inflammatory characteristics in vivo (60, 61) .We showed here that SARS-CoV-2-mediated infections are characterized by a clear dysregulation of type-I IFN response and, consequently, the downstream cytokine signatures, such as IL-4, IL-12, IL-2, and IL-10s, and the downstream type-II IFN response (Figure 4 ).In this study, we analyzed relevant cytokine levels measured in patients, each infected with one of the five major respiratory viral pathogens, through a comprehensive literature curation of the published patient data. We generated a map of such responses to help specialists identify routes of interventions to successfully alleviate CRS in different diseases and evaluate whether they could be used in COVID-19 cases. Based on our literature curation, the five investigated viruses cause atypical cytokine responses in severely ill patients, reported here in Figure 3 .While most studies have focused on clinical or phylogenetic parameters (virus genome, patient age, transmissibility, fatality rate, creatinine, and coagulation among others), we aimed to add a mechanistic understanding to the host immune response. The cytokine response during viral infection is a dynamic process, with multiple changes in the cytokine levels during the course of the infection (62) . During SARS and MERS infection, a slow initial innate immune response accompanied by the infection of alveolar macrophages leads to increased severity of these lower respiratory tract diseases (63) (64) (65) (66) . In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 seems to induce a number of cytokines at a very early stage, possibly explaining why the symptoms of severely ill patients deteriorate rapidly (67) . A long-lasting proinflammatory cytokine production results in high mortality due to the development of severe conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury [9.5% fatality rate for SARS and 34.4% for MERS compared to 2.3% for COVID-19 (43) ].Severe SARS patients show particularly low levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Figures 3, 4) (68) . During MERS infection, patients develop an expected increased production of IL-10, yet the low levels of IFN-γ-inhibiting IL-4 and IL-2 lead to elevated IFN-γ and the induction of type-II IFN response (Figure 3 ) (59, 69, 70) . In contrast, during influenza A infection, the antiviral response activates without much delay with the presence of an intact negative feedback loop. Both viruses considered in our curation induce most of the proand anti-inflammatory cytok']",The antiviral response plays a role in the immune system.,"The antiviral response in the immune system plays a crucial role in defending the body against viral infections.

105,How was the weighted precision evaluated for the safetypins class in the automated vision-based inspection for power line maintenance?,"["" the fault diagnosis of the safetypins. To compare and benchmark the fault diagnosis, we chose the well-known VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) architecture. In both tasks, image augmentation was used to improve the generalization of the models. For object detection the brightness of the images was randomly adjusted. For the classification task, where cropped images of safetypins were classified, we applied horizontal and vertical flipping, random brightness adjustment, width as well as height range shifting, and random image blurring.The component detectors were implemented using the Tensorflow 3 DL framework 4 (Abadi et al. 2015) with models pretrained on the MS COCO dataset (Lin et al. 2014) . The image classifiers were realized using the Keras DL library 5 (Chollet et al. 2015) which provides image classification models pretrained on the ILSVRC dataset (Russakovsky et al. 2015) .For the evaluation of DF1-DF3 and DP1 and DP2 respectively, we conducted both an artificial evaluation to closely assess the pipeline's efficacy and efficiency as well as a naturalistic evaluation to generally judge the design's acceptance and usefulness. In accordance, the evaluation episodes were guided by the questions below: Artificial evaluation of the model component (EE I.I) The efficiency evaluation of the proposed pipelines required two considerations. First, the pipeline's ability to detect the chosen components needed to be evaluated. Second, the accuracy of the fault diagnosis -which we performed for detected safetypins -had to be assessed.Evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the detection task in terms of average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP) (Rafael Padilla and da Silva 2020), we compared our proposed MSCD to the SSCD pipeline. As we were working with our own proprietary dataset DS Ro , the available images were split into a training set comprising 80% of the data, with the remaining 20% used for the evaluation set. To increase the evaluation's validity, images captured at one tower were held out from the random split and solely utilized for the evaluation dataset, while maintaining the split ratio. This image-level split was kept consistent across the derived datasets DS1 Co and DS2 Fi . The SSCD pipeline was fine-tuned to detect the respective component classes using the DS Ro dataset. Accordingly, both detection stages of the MSCD pipeline were fine-tuned on DS1 Co and DS2 Fi respectively. All models were trained using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer with 0.0003 (Faster R-CNN) and 0.001 (SSD) initial learning rate respectively, 0.9 momentum, and batch size 64. We determined the models by using early stopping on the validation loss with a patience of 100 for all models. The testing results of the different pipelines using the different architectures are shown in Fig. 6 . The performance for the safetypin class is disclosed in terms of inter pipeline performance for both the SSCD and the MSCD pipeline as well as the intra pipeline performance for solely the MSCD pipeline.We evaluated the fault diagnosis task performed for the safetypins class in terms of weighted precision, weighted recall, and weighted F 1 -score (Pedregosa et al. 2011) to account for class imbalance. We applied a 3-fold cross validated grid-search to identify the optimal combination of parameters. We chose to account for the following parameter: unfrozen convolutional layers, dense layer size, optimizer and its respective learning rate, dropout rate, and batch size. The images in dataset DS3 Pi were shuffled, a hold out set containing 10% of the images was retained and the remaining images were split into 3 folds. Consequently, for each grid search configuration three models were trained with early stopping with patience 30. The best resulting model of the Resnet and VGG16 model were harnessed to be evaluated on the retained hold out set. The results of the evaluation of the cropped safetypin classification task based on the test set are shown in Table 6 . All details on the machine learning steps and choices are depicted within Sect.

53,What is the genotype of the NDV strain isolated from the vaccinated layer flock in Egypt?,"["" [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Studies with MAbs established with the apathogenic strain NDV-D26 (genotype 2.I.1.1) established three different epitopes sensitive for both HI and NI activity of MAbs and mapped these sites to different amino acids when escape variants were analyzed [34] . Likewise HI-positive MAb AVS-I, raised against the avirulent LaSota vaccine strain (genotype 2.II) [35] mapped to aa residue 570 that was close to but not part of the other described epitopes [36] . This indicates that NDV strains might express at least slightly different neutralizing epitope patterns. Information for such epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII is not available.In order to characterize antigenic sites of circulating NDV genotype 2.VII, we generated genotype-specific MAbs that are able to block biologically active sites of the HN protein, i.e. antibodies that are able to neutralize infectivity and/or block HA activity. For this approach biophysically enriched HN protein fraction of purified virus proved to be an efficient antigen and the applied Concanavalin A (ConA)-ELISA technique that binds antigen not directly on the plate but coupled by the lectin, provided a high throughput system suitable to detect antibodies to conformation sensitive sites. The resulting MAbs were used to recognize unique neutralizing epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII.NDV strain chicken/EGY/NR730/2016 (NR730; Gen-Bank Acc. no. MH899939) was isolated from an ND vaccinated layer flock in Egypt suffering from respiratory distress. The virus was characterized as velogenic having an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 1.8 and belonged to genotype 2.VII.1.1 (formerly 2.VIIb) [37] . Pigeon type paramyxovirus-1 (pigeon/Germany/ R75/1998), genotype 2.VI, was derived from the repository of the ND reference laboratory at the FLI (Acc. No. KJ736742) and NDV/clone 30, genotype 2.II, was derived from a commercial vaccine (MSD, New Jersey, USA). As a source of polyclonal reference antibodies, watery egg yolk preparation from eggs from specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens was used, immunized repeatedly with specified inactivated NDV antigens. A monospecific rabbit α-NDV-HN serum and α-NDV-F serum [38] were used for specific detection of NDV-HN protein by western blot (WB) analysis. Immunizations were carried out in accordance with the legally approved protocol (MV-LALLF-7221.3-2.5-010/10).Virus was propagated in embryonated SPF chicken eggs (ECE) as described [39] (VALO BioMedia GmbH, Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany). Amino-allantoic fluid (AAF) was harvested on day 3 post infection (dpi) and purified by sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation. Briefly, debris was cleared from AAF by low speed centrifugation (30 min at 10,976 × g; 10,000 rpm Rotor JA-10; Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). Then virus was spun down by ultra-centrifugation (1.5 h at 96,281 × g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor, Beckman Coulter). Virus pellets from 6 tubes were re-suspended in a total of 45 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 1 M KCl (KCl-PBS) before adding 15 mL of the virus suspension on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30-60%, in KCl-PBS). Visible bands forming after ultra-centrifugation overnight (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter) were collected and diluted 1:5 in KCl-PBS before pelleting the virus by ultra-centrifugation for 1.5 h (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter). The final virus pellets, representing a total of 228 mL AAF were collected and resuspended in 1.5 ml KCl-PBS. The protein concentration of the obtained virus suspension was determined according to Bradford using the Roti ® -Quant protein quantitation assay (Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) following the producer's instructions.

133,Who should be prioritized in humanitarian emergencies based on their non-communicable diseases?,"['s, such as disability, stroke or amputation from diabetes should be considered (See Table 1 ). In accordance with the public health approach in humanitarian crises, some services/interventions need to be temporarily deprioritized in the initial phase of the response and integrated later on. Other interventions might not be relevant or feasible at the health facility where care is provided. For example, provision of cancer chemotherapy or dialysis for end-stage renal disease is rarely possible [19] and cannot be sustained by agencies with short-term mandates. These patients should be referred to second and third level hospitals wherever possible, as they require resource-intensive diagnostic and treatment means. Moreover, by enrolling patients into long-term programs and life-long therapies such as cancer care and renal dialysis comes financial and ethical responsibility [17] . However, supportive/palliative components of care should be provided at every stage of the response [20] .In each humanitarian emergency, selection of the NCDs to be addressed should also be based on local disease burden (see example Pakistan, Table 1 ), needs of the affected population, factors related to the context, and local and agency capacity in providing services. Chronic conditions such as epilepsy, pre-existing severe mental disorders or diseases that are highly prevalent in certain regions of the world (such as sickle cell anaemia) can be added when appropriate. Guidance on mental health exists with the ICRC\'s basic psychiatric care package to facilitate provision of care for mental health disorders along with other NCD care. For acute mental illness resulting from the humanitarian crisis, the WHO has developed the mhGAP for humanitarian interventions [21] . In a number of MSF projects, routine screening for depression is included in the care provided to NCD patients, and patients with severe mental illness are managed within the NCD cohort with clinicians trained on mhGAP ""author\'s personal knowledge"".The capacity of the health system to provide care to its population prior to the emergency significantly influences the health and recovery of the population during and following an emergency [15] . In preparing for a response, humanitarian actors need to think about the various scenarios influenced by the context (urban versus rural; conflict versus natural disaster versus public health emergency; possible duration of interventions; security constraints; competing priorities; crisis level; NCD burden and local response capacity prior to the crisis ( Fig. 1) and how this will impact prioritization.Some individuals with NCDs are more prone to critical acute exacerbations or to severe consequences with an interruption in care and need to be prioritized to reduce morbidity and mortality ( Table 2) .For example, an individual with type 1 diabetes is at great risk of serious complications and even death if unable to access insulin for just a few days [22] . Conversely, a person with type 2 diabetes who has been well-controlled on oral hypoglycemic agents is unlikely to suffer any immediate consequences if unable to obtain their oral hypoglycemic for a few weeks, even months. Therefore, in the acute phase of an emergency, a system for triage and prioritization of individuals based on the risk of complications and severity of their chronic disease should be implemented. This approach is particularly important in settings where resources are limited. Other ""risk or vulnerability factors"", such as stress, loss of family, loss of livelihood and home, being disabled, extremes of age, etc. could also be considered.The proposed considerations for the management of NCDs in humanitarian settings are centered on key components, embedded within the overarching principles of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) (i.e. people-centered, accessible, equitable, comprehensive, integrated, accountable and efficient care) [23] . These elements are built on strong ethical principles. The overall humanitarian response to NCDs requires advocacy and research to further strengthen implementation.Key components of NCD care delivery NCD management should ensure continuity of care through an integrated approach at each level of health care focusing on primary care with referral pathways to prevent excess mortality and morbidity. An integrated PHC approach will enable a more sustainable and comprehensive intervention, especially if implemented through local facilities. In absence of a functional local health structure, a reliable health partner should be identified, supported and empowered, where possible avoiding vertical programming [16, [24] [25] [26] . However, in alignment with the existing system, NCD management should be supported where it exists, as for example in Libya, where the ICRC is supporting specialised diabetes The prevalence of diabetes in Pakistan is estimated by the WHO to be 9.8% [18] . In 2016 more than 15% of lower limb amputations followedup at the physical rehabilitation center of Muzzafarabad, Pakistan were related to diabetes complications.Recognising the burden of diabetic foot problems which could be prevented, the health directorate of Muzzafarabad asked the ICRC in 2017 to support them in decentralisation of diabetes care from tertiary to the PHC level, with links to the community and referral to secondary and tertiary care as needed.', 'Operational considerations for the management of non-communicable diseases in humanitarian emergencies\nThe increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD) is a global challenge causing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 71% of global deaths (41 million) in 2018, with 85% of the deaths in people between the ages of 30 and 69 years occurring in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1] . NCDs and humanitarian crises often co-occur in LMICs, providing additional challenges for the management of NCDs in these settings where weak health systems collide with the challenges of a humanitarian response. The number of displaced persons (either refugees or internally displaced) has reached the highest level in history, estimated at more than 70 million people [2] . Until recently NCDs in humanitarian contexts were a neglected issue [3, 4] . Humanitarian contexts are changing. Protracted crises are now also impacting higher income regions, such as the Middle East, and more displaced persons are settling in urban areas rather than traditional camp settings [5, 6] . This results in impacted populations being more likely to have pre-existing NCDs. All these factors influence the burden of NCDs seen in humanitarian crises as well as the approaches needed to address NCD-related health needs.The WHO\'s Global Action Plan (GAP) for the Prevention and Control of NCDs for 2013-2020 includes recommendations regarding NCDs in the humanitarian response [7] . This document states ""it must be ensured that the use of the services does not expose the users to financial hardship, including in cases of ensuring the continuity of care in the aftermath of emergencies and disasters."" The recommendations also highlight the need to ""improve the availability of life-saving technologies and essential medicines for managing NCDs in the initial phase of an emergency response."" Continuity of care in this context refers to: ""access to comprehensive services and interventions that address the health needs and the well-being of a person, from the identification of a health condition until the recovery of a functional state consistent with the context"" [8] .Given the relatively recent focus on NCDs during emergencies, humanitarian actors recognized the need to harmonize and enhance NCD management in humanitarian crises. Indeed, the humanitarian community has increasingly addressed the needs for NCD care in their activities [9] and developed organization-specific programmatic and clinical guidance. However, there is a lack of a standardized response during operations [3, 10, 11] , which is essential to guarantee continuity of services to people in crisis settings, as well as a lack of evidencebased NCD management guidelines in humanitarian settings [12, 13] . WHO\'s Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN), provides a basis for NCD care in LMICs, but needs to be adapted to humanitarian settings to address the additional challenges of NCD care during crisis, which include disruption of health care services due to damaged and destroyed health facilities, lack of health care workers, difficulties in access to health facilities due to security constraints or damaged infrastructure. Therefore, a common approach of all actors in the field is needed to answer to the needs of patients with NCDs in crisis settings. The aim of this paper is to present operational considerations, aiming at ensuring appropriate planning, management and care for NCD-affected persons during humanitarian emergencies.The informal working group on NCDs in humanitarian settings, formed by members of the WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and others, and led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), teamed up with the University of Geneva and Geneva University Hospitals in order to develop the operational considerations needed to address NCDs in humanitarian settings. This was done by applying a modified nominal group approach through a series of face to face meetings and email exchanges, informed by expert knowledge and relevant literature [14] .Humanitarian response interventions are usually prioritized according to needs and resources. NCDs encompass a spectrum of diseases and care requirements, and a prioritization of NCD services/interventions are required based on the available resources (human, financial, etc.) and on the context [15] . The list of conditions considered as a priority is based on feasibility during an acute humanitarian crisis, burden of disease and demand, avoidable premature deaths as defined in the priority NCDs of the WHO [7] , those which have severe consequences if left untreated [16] , and pre-crisis availability and capacity of the health system [17] .The priority NCDs to be included in humanitarian responses, as defined by the informal working group, are cardiovascular diseases (including heart failure of any etiology and coronary heart disease), high blood pressure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), epilepsy and diabetes. In addition, long-term complications of NCD']",Individuals with non-communicable diseases who are more prone to critical acute exacerbations or severe consequences with an interruption in care should be prioritized in humanitarian emergencies.,"In humanitarian emergencies, prioritization of individuals with non-communicable diseases should be based on factors such as the feasibility of care during the crisis, the burden of the disease, the potential for avoidable premature deaths, the severity of consequences if left untreated, and the capacity of the health system prior to the crisis.

248,What type of reporting on Veterans' life progress should be focused on and why to reduce stigma and stereotypes?,"["" study period spanned only 12 months, which can only give a snapshot of current portrayals, but can not give long-term information about time-trends. As such, longitudinal research is necessary to assess change over time. Third, the study only collected data from a single jurisdiction (Canada), and while comparisons have been made with studies from other jurisdictions, these other studies employed different methodologies and occurred during different time frames. Purpose-built between-country comparative studies would provide a better foundation for the comparison of media coverage between different jurisdictions. Fourth, data collection occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have had an influence on reporting patterns, meaning that the July 2020-July 2021 time period is not a 'typical' year. Fifth, we did not engage in correlational analysis between some of the key variables, nor make any comparisons in coverage between types of media (e.g. English-language versus French-language, page one stories versus inside pages stories etc.), as this was beyond the scope of the present study, and such an approach would be hampered by small cell sizes and low number of cases among relevant variables. The article is purposely descriptive to give an overview of general patterns and adherence to guidelines, which is consistent with the pointed aims of the study and addresses a gap in the literature on Veteran portrayals in the Canadian media. These limitations could be addressed in future purpose-driven research with larger samples conducted over a multi-year period.To conclude, the present study reveals that the Canadian news media frequently focus on issues of honour and commemoration when reporting Veterans. Compared to the US media, there are far fewer articles on Veterans as victims or drug/alcohol issues in Veterans. Moreover, articles about suicide and PTSD tend to adhere to Mindset guidelines, though there remains room for improvement when reporting these issues. However, there are also very few articles about Afghanistan Veterans, female Veterans, and Veterans who served outside the Canadian army.In sum, the results suggest a need for more educational outreach to help Canadian journalists responsibly report Veterans and their issues, with a focus on (i) diversifying coverage to represent the full heterogeneity of Veterans and Veteran experience; (ii) improved adherence to Mindset guidelines when reporting suicide and PTSD in Veterans; (iii) including more stories focusing on mastery of crises, resilience in the face of adversity and messages of hope and recovery in relation to PTSD and suicide; and (iv) reporting Veterans and their experiences outside of newsworthy clusters and anomalous events, especially focusing on successful reintegration and life progress. Such efforts may help shape a wider social climate of respect, inclusion and support for all Canadian Veterans that may lead to less stigma and stereotypes. This can facilitate Veteran integration into society, which in turn can promote their mental health and well-being, and may ultimately help prevent suicide and foster recovery from PTSD and other mental illnesses.""]","The reporting on Veterans' life progress should focus on mastery of crises, resilience in the face of adversity, and messages of hope and recovery in relation to PTSD and suicide.

Using a similar strategy, 206 anti-RBD antibodies were isolated and characterized by Ju et al. [72] . Because these antibodies target different epitopes on RBD, combinations may be explored to enhance antiviral effects. Antibody 4A8 against SARS-CoV-2 has a unique proposed mechanism of action. The 4A8 antibody exhibited neutralization activity against pseudotyped HIV-vectored SARS-CoV-2 and could also protect Vero E6 cells against live SARS-CoV-2 (IC 50 =~0.61 μg/ml). Characterization of binding through BLI showed no interference of ACE2 binding to S protein of SARS-CoV-2 by 4A8 [73] . Structural characterization confirmed that the epitope of 4A8 is on the N-terminal domain (NTD), and established that epitopes outside the RBD can be viable targets for neutralizing antibodies, hinting at possible mechanisms in addition to traditional receptor blocking. It was proposed that 4A8 blocks conformational changes from the pre-to postfusion state of SARS-CoV-2 S protein [73] , thus inhibiting the initial step of fusion and preventing virus entry.Although the current pipeline of COVID-19 antibodies has identified a large number of neutralizing antibodies, there are also challenges. We discuss two that affect the development of these antibodies: (i) somatic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 that may dampen the efficacy of antibodies, and further lead to new viral strains that may gradually develop resistance to existing antibodies, and (ii) unwanted enhancement of immune response via a phenomenon known as ADE.Although retroviruses such as HIV use reverse transcriptase (estimated error rate at 10 −3 misincorporations per nucleotide position per genome replication) during their replication [74] , SARS-CoV-2 uses a higher-fidelity RdRp (with an estimated error rate of 10 −4 to 10 −5 misincorporations per nucleotide position per genome replication) [75] . Hence, SARS-CoV-2 may be less prone to incorporate mutations [76] . However, a broad mutation spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 has been observed, which could lead to vaccine and drug resistance [77] [78] [79] . In one analysis of 7710 assemblies of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) iii database, 198 sites of mutations were identified [80] . Furthermore, Starr et al. showed that most of the mutations are deleterious for RBD expression and ACE2 binding [81] . However, mutation V367F was found to substantially increase RBD expression. Another analysis of the GISAID dataset revealed a number of enriched mutations in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, a major target for neutralizing antibody development: G476S in the RBD; V367F and V483A in RBD 'up/down' conformations; L5F and L8V/W in the signal peptide; H49Y, Y145H/del, and Q239K in the S1 NTD domain; D614G and V615I/F in the S1 subunit; A831V in the potential FP in S2 subunit; D839Y/N/E in the S2 subunit; P1263L in the cytoplasmic tail; and a mutational cluster 937-943 in the fusion core of HR1 ( Figure 3A ) [69] .Further, two other analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have suggested a trend towards enhanced structural stability as well as higher affinity for ACE2, and this may indicate acquired increased infectivity during the pandemic [82] [83] [84] . Recent structural analysis has also shown that the D614G mutation (in the S1 domain, a mutation from a negatively charged amino acid to a flexible amino acid) induced a more stable S protein that can lead to higher infectivity [85] . This may explain why the prevalence of this particular mutation increased from 0% in February 2020 tõ 70% in May 2020 [85, 86] .Moreover, it is interesting to note that some of the mutations that have been sporadically detected are within the epitopes for the neutralizing antibodies B38 (K458R, D405V), S309 (N354D/K and S359N), CR3022 (R408I, K378R, P384L, H519Q), and VHH-72 (R408I, K378R, and P384L) ( Figure 3B ) [39, 45, 68, 70""]","The mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 include K458R, D405V, N354D/K, S359N, R408I, K378R, P384L, H519Q.

253,How does the misuse of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan contribute to antibiotic resistance?,"[' developing secondary bacterial infection for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients has been considered rare. 28 Besides, since the double-blind placebo-controlled studies of AZM with or without hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 did not reveal sufficient efficacy results, there is no scientific evidence for physicians to prescribe AZM for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 29, 30 In the present study, most pharmacists (59.7%) believed that AZM could treat COVID-19. A recent survey in Jordan showed that most pharmacists (55.8%) get their source of information in response to COVID-19 from social media. In Abdelmalek and Mousa contrast, low percentages get their source of information from either the WHO site (6.0%) or scientific journals (5.2%). 31 Since social media containing misinformation or myths increased during the COVID pandemic, general people or professionals started to believe in what they read. 15 One of these myths is that ""antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating new coronavirus."" Thus, it is not unusual for more than half of pharmacists to believe in that statement. Furthermore, the present study showed that less experienced pharmacists believed less that AZM could treat COVID-19 disease and believed more of the negative consequences of using AZM in viral infections. Such belief led them to stock less AZM in their Pharmacy during the pandemic. These results may suggest that fresh pharmacy graduates have more assurance that antibiotics should not be used for viral infections unless preventing secondary bacterial infection. On the other hand, the more experienced pharmacist may tend to go with the flow and believe what they read on social media over the scientific knowledge gained during studying their degree. 15, 31, 32 The latter opens the need for continuous education for pharmacists. Since antibiotic misuse has been high for decades, antibiotic resistance has been of significant concern in developing and developed countries. 15, 16, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] In Jordan, for instance, 73% of Cutibacterium acnes isolated from patients with acne were resistant to erythromycin, 59% to clindamycin, 37% to doxycycline and tetracycline, and 31% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, in a study conducted in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) on 504 healthy college students in Jordan, the researchers found that 40.4% of students carried methicillin-resistant Staphylococci isolated from nasal and skin areas. 37 These isolates were 46% resistant to cefoxitin, 35% to erythromycin, 13% to ciprofloxacin, 12% to nitrofurantoin, and 10% to gentamicin, but not to hospital-restricted injection-type antibiotics, amikacin (1.5%) and vancomycin (0.5%). 37 These results indicate the consequence of the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in Jordan.The concern for developing more antibiotic-resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be significant since the AZM (and other antibiotics) misuse and overuse is two to three folds higher, as presented herein and in other studies. 22, 27 Therefore, new measures of clinical guidelines on using AZM and other antibiotics for COVID-19 patients in Jordan and other countries are warranted. 22, 27, 36 Furthermore, these new measures should be distributed on social media to overcome and balance the false information that the public and the health practitioners are receiving.The present study has limitations. Firstly, although the number of required pharmacies was statistically sufficient, the sample size may not represent the whole pharmacies in Jordan. Secondly, other antibiotics could also be highly used during the pandemic in Jordan. Thirdly, the study included a few sociodemographic variables, whereby more variables might clarify the outcome better.In conclusion, this study demonstrated that AZM is misused by physicians, pharmacists, and the public in Jordan. Since AZM efficacy on SARS-CoV-2 is scarce, there is a need for new guidelines by governmental health authorities to implement strict enforcement of AZM dispensing during COVID-19 to avoid negative consequences of bacterial resistance.The authors declare no conflicts of interest for this work. ']",The misuse of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan contributes to antibiotic resistance.,"The misuse of antibiotics, specifically azithromycin (AZM), during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan can contribute to antibiotic resistance in several ways. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. In the context of the study mentioned, misuse of AZM by physicians, pharmacists, and the public in Jordan can lead to increased resistance to this antibiotic among bacteria.

Furthermore, the study highlighted that misinformation from social media and the belief that antibiotics, including AZM, can treat COVID-19 can lead to inappropriate use of antibiotics. This inappropriate use can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance, as bacteria may adapt and become resistant to antibiotics when they are not used properly.

Moreover, the study indicated that buying antibiotics like AZM without a prescription is not strictly regulated in Jordan. This lack of control over antibiotic dispensing can lead to unnecessary and inappropriate use of antibiotics, which in turn can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance.

Overall, the misuse of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan, particularly AZM, can fuel the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing a significant public health concern.","How does the misuse of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan contribute to antibiotic resistance? ->: The misuse of antibiotics, specifically azithromycin (AZM), during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan can contribute to antibiotic resistance in several ways.

49,What is the purpose of generating genotype-specific MAbs to characterize antigenic sites of NDV genotype 2.VII?,"[' to react to (and neutralize) a broad range of different NDV genotypes; this in turn may also relate to cross-protection against currently circulating field strains after vaccination with genotypically distant strains.Further studies on epitope mapping of MAbs will help to elucidate these specific epitopes. It will be interesting to learn whether genotype-specific antibodies recognize known binding sites but have a different amino acid configuration or whether the genotype 2.VII specific epitopes are formed by different sites. Overall our studies highlight the value of MAb to dissect antigenic sites. The established MAbs are the first step to define genotype 2.VII specific neutralizing sites of NDV based on sequence information and should enable phylogenic analysis of antigenic sites in the future, a prerequisite to elucidate whether antigenic drift was the driving factor for evolution of NDV. In addition, well defined MAbs serve as valuable diagnostic tools to specifically detect NDV antigen for example in lateral flow devices or can be used for serological tests. When, for example, applied in blocking ELISA systems genotype specific reagents would allow to differentiate infected from vaccinated individuals (DIVA) by specifically detecting genotype 2.I, 2.II or 2.VII specific antibodies. The presented work flow provides a powerful method to generate and characterize these reagents.', "" [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Studies with MAbs established with the apathogenic strain NDV-D26 (genotype 2.I.1.1) established three different epitopes sensitive for both HI and NI activity of MAbs and mapped these sites to different amino acids when escape variants were analyzed [34] . Likewise HI-positive MAb AVS-I, raised against the avirulent LaSota vaccine strain (genotype 2.II) [35] mapped to aa residue 570 that was close to but not part of the other described epitopes [36] . This indicates that NDV strains might express at least slightly different neutralizing epitope patterns. Information for such epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII is not available.In order to characterize antigenic sites of circulating NDV genotype 2.VII, we generated genotype-specific MAbs that are able to block biologically active sites of the HN protein, i.e. antibodies that are able to neutralize infectivity and/or block HA activity. For this approach biophysically enriched HN protein fraction of purified virus proved to be an efficient antigen and the applied Concanavalin A (ConA)-ELISA technique that binds antigen not directly on the plate but coupled by the lectin, provided a high throughput system suitable to detect antibodies to conformation sensitive sites. The resulting MAbs were used to recognize unique neutralizing epitopes of NDV genotype 2.VII.NDV strain chicken/EGY/NR730/2016 (NR730; Gen-Bank Acc. no. MH899939) was isolated from an ND vaccinated layer flock in Egypt suffering from respiratory distress. The virus was characterized as velogenic having an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 1.8 and belonged to genotype 2.VII.1.1 (formerly 2.VIIb) [37] . Pigeon type paramyxovirus-1 (pigeon/Germany/ R75/1998), genotype 2.VI, was derived from the repository of the ND reference laboratory at the FLI (Acc. No. KJ736742) and NDV/clone 30, genotype 2.II, was derived from a commercial vaccine (MSD, New Jersey, USA). As a source of polyclonal reference antibodies, watery egg yolk preparation from eggs from specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens was used, immunized repeatedly with specified inactivated NDV antigens. A monospecific rabbit α-NDV-HN serum and α-NDV-F serum [38] were used for specific detection of NDV-HN protein by western blot (WB) analysis. Immunizations were carried out in accordance with the legally approved protocol (MV-LALLF-7221.3-2.5-010/10).Virus was propagated in embryonated SPF chicken eggs (ECE) as described [39] (VALO BioMedia GmbH, Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany). Amino-allantoic fluid (AAF) was harvested on day 3 post infection (dpi) and purified by sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation. Briefly, debris was cleared from AAF by low speed centrifugation (30 min at 10,976 × g; 10,000 rpm Rotor JA-10; Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). Then virus was spun down by ultra-centrifugation (1.5 h at 96,281 × g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor, Beckman Coulter). Virus pellets from 6 tubes were re-suspended in a total of 45 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 1 M KCl (KCl-PBS) before adding 15 mL of the virus suspension on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30-60%, in KCl-PBS). Visible bands forming after ultra-centrifugation overnight (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter) were collected and diluted 1:5 in KCl-PBS before pelleting the virus by ultra-centrifugation for 1.5 h (96,281×g; 28,000 rpm, 32Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter). The final virus pellets, representing a total of 228 mL AAF were collected and resuspended in 1.5 ml KCl-PBS.

In March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) determined that COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic [1] . This crisis has profoundly affected all aspects of the society, including the psychological well-being of people [2] . Previous studies have revealed psychological impact of COVID-19 on anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality depending on demographic factors and preexisting psychiatric illnesses [3, 4] .Chronic medical comorbidity might play a role in the psychological impact of COVID-19. Patients with chronic medical diseases are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19. They also have higher risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 infection-related complications with poorer prognosis than healthy controls [5] . They also have great fears that a collapse of the healthcare system by COVID-19 may prevent them from receiving appropriate and timely treatment [6] .Likewise, patients undergoing dialysis can have psychological distress during this outbreak. It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with depression and anxiety, making patients more vulnerable to COVID-19-related stress [7] [8] [9] . Moreover, patients with CKD have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection-related complications and poorer prognosis including higher risks of hospitalization, intensive unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death [10, 11] .In addition, difference in dialysis modalities can affect the psychological impact of COVID-19 on dialysis patients [12] . For example, patients undergoing hemodialysis are highly dependent on medical institutions. They have to stay in the dialysis center for four hours three times weekly, lying in bed next to each other. Most dialysis centers perform standard precautions for infection control. Droplet-mediated viral infections can spread widely when patients undergo hemodialysis. If one patient in the dialysis center is diagnosed with COVID-19, all members of the dialysis center might have to be isolated. Thus, the Korean Society of Nephrology made a policy allowing only patients with body temperatures of less than 37.5˚C without symptoms of COVID-19 to enter the dialysis center [13] . As a result, mild symptoms can delay hemodialysis until the patient is proven to be negative for COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. In contrast, patients undergoing PD usually visit the hospital once a month unless they have special problems because they are trained to perform PD on their own at home. In terms of receiving dialysis, HD patients are more dependent on medical institutions while PD patients play an important role in dialysis themselves.In this study, we aimed to investigate COVID-19-related psychological stress experienced by dialysis patients and differences in concerns about COVID-19 between HD and PD patients. End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients were defined as those who had kidney function less than 15ml/min/1.73m 2 classified by CKD grade 5 who needed kidney replacement therapy such as kidney transplantation or dialysis. Our participants were patients with ESKD undergoing dialysis. They decided their dialysis modalities after receiving balanced information [14] .We hypothesized that patients with dialysis would show severe psychological distress and concerns related to COVID-19 and that the dialysis modality would affect the psychological impact of COVID-19.This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted at Soonchunhyang University Hospital Cheonan. The survey was conducted from August 2020 to September 2020 when monthly number of COVID-19 diagnosis cases had reached an all-time high since COVID-19 was found in Korea (3,865 cases in August and 5,642 cases in September). The Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of Soonchunhyang University Hospital Cheonan approved this study (IRB number: 2020-07-029). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrollment in this study.There were 224 outpatients undergoing both HD and PD in our artificial kidney center. Artificial kidney center doctors verbally explained this study and gave information about this study to potential participants. Among potential participants, those aged from 18 to 90 years with cognitive ability to respond to the questionnaire were included in this study. Patients with hospitalization within three months or those presenting with acute illness were excluded (Fig 1) . We reviewed medical records and analyzed laboratory data to assess whether dialysis was performed adequately. Information on the causative disease of dialysis and dialysis vintage were obtained by reviewing']","The COVID-19 pandemic can cause psychological distress in dialysis patients, and the dialysis modality can also impact it.","The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to increase psychological distress among dialysis patients, particularly those undergoing hemodialysis (HD) compared to peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.

Hence, in such a case, options to elongate the half-life of nanobody candidates should be taken before moving to the clinic. These may include linking a nanobody to anti-human serum albumin (HSA), a technique that has been proven to increase the serum half-life to~6 days in cynomolgus monkeys [112] . Another strategy to circumvent ADE is the introduction of a LALA mutation (Leu234Ala together with Leu235Ala) into the Fc to minimize FcR activation and Fc-mediated toxicity of human antibody candidates against SARS-CoV-2. This has been done with JS016 (currently in clinical trial) which employs a LALA mutation in the Fc to minimize FcγR activation and Fcmediated toxicity, and also with antibody CB6 where CB6-LALA is currently being investigated in clinical trials (Table 1 ) [71] .We are currently experiencing an explosion of research into antibodies to combat COVID-19 that include neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1 ) and therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. To date, 8 neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical evaluation -LY-CoV555, JS016, REGN-COV2, TY027, BRII-196, BRII-198, CT-P59, and SCTA01. It is understood that SARS-CoV-2 may develop resistance to a single neutralizing antibody by accumulating spontaneous mutations [88, 89] . To overcome this problem, antibody cocktails such as REGN-COV2, AZD7442, and COVI-SHIELD have entered clinical trials (Table 1) . Further, multiple research programs have also started to work on antibodies against conserved epitopes that would avoid the SARS-CoV-2 mutations that are currently being observed in the pandemic. This will enable us to get ahead of the potential issue of viral resistance [53, 81, 88, 89, 113, 114] . Efforts will also be necessary to discover conserved functional neutralizing epitopes that, once mutated, can cause SARS-CoV-2 to lose its infectivity. To circumvent the potential problem of ADE, several strategies are being explored, including the use of nanobodies lacking the Fc domain and the introduction of the LALA mutation into the Fc domain.Given the development of fruitful concurrent pipelines of antibodies against COVID-19 driven by close collaboration between academia and industry, we hold optimism that broadly neutralizing candidates will emerge that induce less or no ADE, and thus play a major role in therapy and protection against COVID-19. Over the next few years we are likely to see an expansion of preclinical research and gain extensive experience in the development of antibodies against COVID-19 in the clinic. An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 will better prepare us for the next pandemic (see Outstanding Questions).We thank Dr Shaolei Teng (Howard University) for sharing the analysis of mutations on S protein of SARS-CoV-2. We thank all colleagues from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) COVID-19 team for helpful comments and advice in the preparation of this manuscript. This research was supported in by the NCATS Intramural Research Program of the NIH. What is the best strategy to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies against conserved epitopes of SARS-CoV-2?What are the ways to combat antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) from neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19?', '] . Although the frequencies of these mutations are low, and none has been found to be enriched in the current pandemic, these highlight that such mutations can potentially diminish or abolish the effectiveness of the currently available and in-developmentantibodies [66, 87] . Because spontaneously arising mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains can be positively selected, and ultimately become the dominant strain to achieve viral escape under pressure from a neutralizing antibody [88] [89] [90] [91] , strategies have been developed to protect against this. One strategy is to design broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes in the RBD because these are less likely to mutate [92] [93] [94] . Another method to combat potential escape mutants is to use a combination of several neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies in cocktails would target distinct epitopes, enabling an additive effect in potency. Indeed, such strategies have been employed for earlier outbreaks, as seen in Ebola (REGN-EB3) and SARS-CoV-1 (antibody cocktail of CR3014 and CR3022) [66] . These previous successes spurred Regeneron to start the development of a dual antibody cocktail for COVID-19 (REGN-COV2, a combination of two antibodies, REGN10933 + REGN10987; Table 1 ) [88, 89] . AstraZeneca has also confirmed a pair of mAbs (AZD8895 + AZD1061) that will be taken forward as a combination therapy, known as AZD7442, into clinical development (Table 1 ). It is anticipated that this cocktail strategy may be crucial in increasing the potency of antibodies for use against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutating strains.Antibodies represent a double-edged sword in that they can both neutralize and enhance viral infection [95] : highly potent neutralizing antibodies can recognize specific viral epitopes and block viral entry to the host cells, whereas poorly neutralizing antibodies can promote infection through a phenomenon known as ADE. ADE is seen in responses to many infectious diseases including dengue fever, in which the natural progression of the disease has been shown to utilize antibodies from the primary response to infection as a basis for increased severity in later secondary infections [96] . Similarly, poorly neutralizing antibodies or antibodies with low affinity can promote virus entry upon secondary infection, resulting in increased viral burden and more severe disease progression via ADE (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] . Mechanisms of ADE largely rely on the uptake of virus-antibody immune complexes into host immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes, a process that is mediated through interactions between the Fc domain on the antibodies and Fc receptor (FcR) on host cells. These virus-antibody immune complexes in turn initiate different downstream proinflammatory signaling pathways, leading to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased viral load (Figure 4 ) [97] [98] [99] .ADE has previously been observed for antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 [100] [101] [102] . Upon rechallenge in SARS-CoV-1-vaccinated rhesus macaques, passive transfer of anti-spike IgG correlated with disease progression, as observed by the presence of severe diffuse alveolar damage and loss of disease tolerance [103, 104] . It was observed that the same antisera against SARS-CoV-1 may confer neutralization or enhancement based solely on the concentrations of the antisera employed where enhancement and neutralization occur at lower and higher concentrations, respectively [102] . Thus, a threshold dependent on both antibody concentration and affinity may need to be considered in aiming to confer neutralization instead of enhancement [103] .Convalescent plasma therapy for infectious diseases is also known to be more effective as a prophylactic if administered shortly after symptoms arise when viral titers are thought to be lower [31, 105, 106] , suggesting that the threshold of viral load is also an important factor to consider. Although to date (as of 28 July 2020) there have been no observations of ADE in antibodies currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 [107] , in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as two early clinical studies in China, showed that patients with severe disease frequently had an increased IgG response [108] [109] [110] . These accumulated data raise the possibility of ADE by antibodies in COVID-19, and close attention should be paid to the matter. In addition to antibody concentration/affinity and viral load, there are two other ways in which ADE can be avoided. Both involve the Fc, the interacting partner on the virus-antibody complexes that initiates ADE. Nanobodies lacking the Fc domain would potentially avoid the pitfall of ADE [111]']","The best strategy to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies against conserved epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 is to target conserved epitopes in the RBD and use a combination of several neutralizing antibodies.

34,How is psychological distress associated with COVID-19 in dialysis patients?,"[' (Table 5) . We compared precautionary measures taken for COVID-19 between HD and PD patients. Results are shown in Table 4 . Table 5 shows results of correlation between psychological distress and precautionary measures in the whole cohort. We also analyzed each group separately. Results are shown in Table 6 . There was no significant difference in precautionary measures except for the compliance of wearing masks between HD and PD patients. PD patients had better compliance of wearing masks regardless of symptoms than HD patients in the matched cohort, showing a less significant (p = 0.018) difference between the two. PD patients answered either ""very likely"" (68.6%) or ""somewhat likely""(31.4%) to the question about wearing masks. In contrast, 6.4% (n = 5) of HD patients answered ""not very likely."" Symptoms of stress and insomnia were associated with wearing masks in the whole cohort (Table 5 ). More PD patients tended to self report adherence to cough etiquette and hand hygiene than HD patients, although the difference between the two was not statistically significant. Of PD patients, 45.7% answered ""very likely"" to the question about whether they covered their mouths when coughing and sneezing, whereas only 29.5% of HD patients did so (p = 0.757). Regarding hand hygiene, 26.9% of PD patients and 13.5% of HD patients answered ""very likely"" about washing hands (p = 0.166). There was no significant difference patients in the habit of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks) during meals between HD and PD patients. The average time staying at In this study, we investigated COVID-19-related psychological stress experienced by dialysis patients and the difference in concerns between HD and PD patients. First, dialysis patients had relatively high psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Second, HD patients showed higher psychological distress and concerns related to COVID-19 than PD patients. Third, various concerns and precautionary measures for COVID-19 were associated with the psychological distress of HD and PD patients. In a previous study that meta-analyzed factors associated with psychological distress, pre-existing physical conditions with higher COVID-19 infection risk were associated with higher anxiety and depression [22] , consistent with results of the present study showing a high degree of anxiety and depression symptoms and psychological distress in dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Sources of distress might include feelings of vulnerability or the loss of control and concerns about one\'s health and the spread of the virus [23] . The fact that COVID-19 is transmitted humanto-human and that it is associated with high morbidity might intensify the perception of personal health problems, especially for patients with chronic illnesses [24, 25] . However, due to the sudden occurrence of this outbreak, we were unable to assess an individual\'s psychological condition before the outbreak. Since there were no data before COVID-19, it was difficult to conclude that the more pronounced psychological distress of HD patients was only due to COVID-19. Interestingly, a recent study in the Netherlands [26] investigating the mental health of dialysis patients (on HD, PD, and home hemodialysis [HHD]) during COVID-19 and compared with the period preceding the pandemic has reported the mental health of dialysis patients is unaffected by the pandemic. To overcome this limitation, we included concerns and precautionary measures taken for COVID-19 and showed their associations with the psychological distress of patients. We also tried to identify the difference between HD and PD patients. They decided their dialysis modalities with balanced information. As a result, they have a unique medical behavior. Thus, it is worth to investigate how dialysis modalities work in the COVID-19 era. According to our study, the psychological distress of COVID-19 was more pronounced in HD patients than in PD patients. Interestingly, in our regression analysis, HD patients had lower level of confidence. This can be related to the severity of their depressive and anxiety symptoms. The nature of patients undergoing HD being highly dependent on the hospitals and doctors might have an impact on the above results. Regarding concerns about COVID-19, more than half of both HD and PD patients felt there was too much unnecessary worry about COVID-19. Chronic disease patients experienced psychological distress more than the general population in previous studies [22, 27] , similar to our results. In addition, compared to PD patients, more HD patients responded that they felt less likely to be exposed to the virus. However, only a few of them answered that they would survive if infected with COVID-19. These results suggest that HD patients might have cognitive bias related to risk perception and more emotional impact than PD patients. Cognitive biases are associated with psychopathology. They may alter threat perception, while risk perception is strongly associated with the emotional impact of the threat itself [28] . In terms of precautionary measures, PD patients maintained cough etiquette better with']",Psychological distress is more pronounced in HD patients than in PD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic period.,"Psychological distress in dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic period appears to be more pronounced in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) compared to those undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD).

The study indicates that various concerns and precautionary measures taken for COVID-19 are associated with psychological distress in dialysis patients, highlighting the need for interventions to prevent psychological distress and depression in this vulnerable population.","How is psychological distress associated with COVID-19 in dialysis patients? ->: Psychological distress in dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic period appears to be more pronounced in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) compared to those undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD).

223,How does the alpha rhythm in the thalamus relate to changes in gamma power and lateral inhibition in thalamocortical dysrhythmia?,"[' there is a final common pathway linking disorders of phantom perception, including e.g., migraine, tinnitus, neurogenic pain, and Parkinson\'s disease, 25 that slows the resting state alpha rhythm (8-13Hz) generated by the thalamus to just 4-7 Hz, 30 and is accompanied by an increase in gamma power due to changes in lateral inhibition within thalamocortical circuits. 25, 95 In our cohort of VSS patients, we did not observe any slowing of alpha rhythms measured from the cortex; however, we did observe functionally increased gamma-band power, potentially related to changes in E-I interactions. 27, 74, 81 Furthermore, our findings of reduced alpha-gamma PAC in VSS suggest that alpha-rhythms, typically generated by the thalamus, may become decoupled from gamma oscillations in the visual cortex. 25, 37 Interestingly, under the TCD framework, 25 if thalamic rhythms have slowed to 4-7Hz in VSS, the visual cortex may become preferentially entrained to the theta rhythm (i.e., increased theta-gamma PAC). However, in this study, the length of each trial was insufficient to accurately quantify theta-gamma coupling. 39 To further test the TCD framework, future work should focus on studying potential dysthymias directly within the thalamus and/or via thalamocortical connectivity. While, deep-brain structures like the thalamus are notoriously challenging to measure with noninvasive arrays of MEG sensors placed outside the head, 21 recent progress has shown that it is possible, 96 given certain constraints. 97, 98 However, in this study, the quality of the MEG-MRI co-registration, and the resulting forward model, were not good enough for reliably measuring subcortical activity. Therefore, future work should aim to utilise subject-specific 3D-printed scanner-casts and high-quality structural MRI scans in VSS cohorts.Our study is based on a relatively small number of VSS and control participants. Participant recruitment was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effect sizes of group differences should be considered: d = .738 for gamma power (which can be described as ""medium"" to ""large""); and d = 1.24 for the alpha-gamma PAC result (which can be described as ""very large""). This strengthens our confidence in the inferences drawn from the results.Future studies should replicate and extend our findings, focusing on characterising dysfunctional oscillatory activity in VSS, with even greater precision. Larger cohorts of participants would also allow neuroimaging findings to be directly related to the clinical symptoms of the condition, a crucial consideration given that VSS exists on a continuum with significant variances in the severity of reported symptoms. 1, 10 Finally, this study opted to use a high-contrast visual grating to elicit specific visual oscillations in the early visual cortex.However, it remains unclear whether our findings generalise to more complex perceptual stimuli. Interestingly, VSS patients report that certain stimuli trigger ""snow"" symptoms more than others. More naturalistic stimuli (e.g., images and videos) combined with MEG could be used to isolate which particular aspects of the visual world intensify VSS symptoms.Immersive virtual reality environments could also be used in combination with new wearable MEG systems. 99This study used MEG to study neuronal oscillations during visual processing in a cohort of visual snow syndrome (VSS) patients and control participants. Compared with controls, VSS patients displayed significantly increased gamma (40-70Hz) power in the primary visual cortex and reduced phase-amplitude coupling, suggesting that cortical activity in VSS during early visual processing is hyperactive and disorganised, results that are consistent with theories of thalamocortical dysrhythmia. ']","The alpha rhythm in the thalamus slows down to 4-7 Hz in thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which is accompanied by an increase in gamma power due to changes in lateral inhibition within thalamocortical circuits.","The alpha rhythm in the thalamus is typically generated at 8-13Hz and plays a role in coordinating brain activity, including top-down modulation, prediction, and attentional sampling. In disorders like thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which involves conditions such as visual snow syndrome (VSS), there can be a slowing of the alpha rhythm generated by the thalamus to just 4-7Hz. This slowing can lead to changes in lateral inhibition within thalamocortical circuits, resulting in an increase in gamma power. The increase in gamma power is thought to be due to alterations in E-I interactions. Additionally, in VSS, reduced alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling has been observed, suggesting that alpha rhythms generated by the thalamus may become decoupled from gamma oscillations in the visual cortex. This decoupling could be related to atypical mechanisms for top-down control via alpha-band phase relationships. Further research is needed to study potential dysthymias directly within the thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity to better understand the relationship between the alpha rhythm in the thalamus and changes in gamma power and lateral inhibition in thalamocortical dysrhythmia.","How does the alpha rhythm in the thalamus relate to changes in gamma power and lateral inhibition in thalamocortical dysrhythmia? ->: The alpha rhythm in the thalamus is typically generated at 8-13Hz and plays a role in coordinating brain activity, including top-down modulation, prediction, and attentional sampling.

7,What is the behavior of H5N1 influenza viruses in ferrets?,"[' receptors [153] . However, other investigators found that H5N1 influenza viruses were able to infect ex vivo cultures of the human upper respiratory tract, i.e., nasopharyngeal, adenoid and tonsillar tissues, despite the lack of a-2,3 sialic acid receptors in these tissues [154] . The tropism of H5N1 influenza viruses in the respiratory tract of humans and other species remains equivocal and further studies, in which a number of different isolates are evaluated in larger numbers of animals, are needed.The behavior of AI viruses of the H7 subtype has been studied in ferrets. Human isolates of highly pathogenic H7N7 influenza viruses replicated to higher titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract of ferrets than low pathogenicity H7N2 influenza viruses isolated from humans. The H7N7 viruses also replicated in nonrespiratory tissues [115] . The H7N7 isolate A/NL/219/2003 caused severe illness, including significant weight loss, caused neurological symptoms and was lethal in 2 out of 3 ferrets inoculated. Another highly pathogenic H7N7 AI virus, A/NL/230/ 2003, and the low pathogenicity H7N2 viruses evaluated in this study, did not cause severe disease and were not lethal in this model. Joseph et al. [116] demonstrated that the pattern of antigenic relatedness of H7 subtype AI viruses, determined using post-infection ferret sera, was similar to that observed in mice. The ferret model was used to evaluate attenuation, immunogenicity and efficacy of the H7N3 ca live attenuated vaccine virus [124] . The vaccine virus was restricted in replication in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets and did not replicate to detectable levels in the lungs or in the brain. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of ferrets immunized with a single dose of the H7N3 ca vaccine 4 weeks after immunization, and a second dose of vaccine provided a boost in the antibody response. Two doses of vaccine significantly reduced the replication of homologous and heterologous highly pathogenic H7 influenza viruses in the lungs of ferrets and prevented their spread to the brain and the olfactory bulb.Ferrets immunized with an inactivated vaccine derived from an H7N1-PR8 reassortant based on HPAI A/chicken/Italy/13474/99 (H7N1), with alum adjuvant, mounted a serum HAI (GMT 76) and neutralizing antibody (range 42-200) response after two 24 mg doses of vaccine [122] . Cross-reactive HAI titers against heterologous Eurasian and North American H7 viruses were detectable but low (titer . Vaccination of ferrets resulted in reduced signs of illness, shedding of virus from the upper and lower respiratory tract and systemic spread following challenge with HPAI A/chicken/Italy/13474/99 (H7N1).There are few reports in the scientific literature that describe the replication and clinical signs resulting from infection of ferrets with other AI subtypes. Hinshaw et al. [155] demonstrated that AI viruses of the H2, H3, H6, H7, and H10 subtypes, as well as an H7N7 virus isolated from a seal, replicated in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, but elicited low or undetectable levels of antibody. None of these AI isolates tested caused any signs of disease in infected ferrets. Replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity of AI viruses of the H6 subtype were evaluated in the ferret model. Following evaluation in the mouse model of infection, four AI viruses of the H6 subtype that replicated to varying degrees in mice were studied in ferrets [145] . As in mice, the viruses replicated to lower titers in the upper respiratory tract than in the lungs, although the difference in titers was much less than in mice (~10fold lower titers in ferrets vs. 10-1,000-fold difference seen in mice). All four viruses replicated to a peak titer of about 10 7 TCID 50 /g in ferret lungs, although the peak titer occurred at different timepoints post-infection. Transient weight loss and fever were observed in ferrets infected with the A/teal/HK/97 and A/quail/HK/99 viruses that were lethal in mice, but also in ferrets that received the influenza A/mallard/Alberta/85 (H6N2) virus, which caused no signs of illness in mice. Ferrets infected with influenza A/duck/HK/77 (H6N9) did not exhibit weight loss or fever, but, unlike mock-infected ferrets, they failed to gain weight during the period of observation. Ant', ' implicated as the donor of the internal protein genes of the H5N1 AI viruses that emerged in 1997 [140, 144] . In addition, there is serological evidence of human infections with H6 AI viruses in China [143] .The replication, pathogenicity and immunogenicity of several H6 AI viruses have been studied in mice [145] . Fourteen temporally and antigenically diverse H6 AI viruses of various NA subtypes, from both the Eurasian and North American lineages, were evaluated in BALB/c mice. Following intranasal inoculation of 10 5 TCID 50 of virus, replication of varying efficiency was observed in the respiratory tract of mice. Eleven of the 14 viruses replicated in the lower respiratory tract, ten in the upper respiratory tract; only one of the viruses failed to replicate to detectable levels in mice. Higher titers of the viruses were observed in the lungs of mice compared to the nasal turbinates. Two viruses from Hong Kong, A/teal/W312/HK/ 97 (H6N1) and A/quail/HK/1721-30/99 (H6N1) caused significant weight loss, illness, and death in mice, but their replication appeared to be limited to the respiratory tract. H6 AI viruses that replicated well in the lungs elicited high neutralizing antibody titers in infected mice, but the immunogenicity of H6 viruses did not correlate with their efficiency of replication in the respiratory tract. The cross-reactivity of the neutralizing antibodies was not an accurate predictor of protection. Live attenuated, cold-adapted candidate vaccines were generated from three of the H6 AI viruses studied [146] . Immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate vaccines were evaluated in mice. A single intranasal dose of each vaccine virus elicited serum neutralizing and HAI antibody, and fully protected mice against replication of the wild-type parent H6 AI virus in the lower respiratory tract. Cross-reactive antibody titers against heterologous H6 viruses were significantly lower than against the homologous parent virus. A second dose of vaccine in mice boosted the antibody titers, and improved cross-protection against the heterologous H6 AI viruses. As had been seen in the initial studies in mice, the level of neutralizing antibody elicited by the H6 candidate vaccines was a poor predictor of their ability to cross-protect against antigenically distinct H6 AI viruses. A candidate A/teal/HK/97 (H6N1) cold-adapted vaccine elicited the broadest cross-protective response, and this vaccine virus is currently undergoing evaluation in human clinical trials.The ability of a limited number of AI subtypes to replicate and cause disease in ferrets has been investigated, and not surprisingly, the behavior of H5 subtype viruses has been the most studied. Zitzow and colleagues [147] demonstrated that two H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from human cases of infection in Hong Kong in 1997 were capable of replication not only in the respiratory tract, but also in the brain, spleen and intestines of ferrets. Virus replication was associated with clinical signs of disease such as severe lethargy, sneezing, rhinitis, hind limb paresis and, in some cases, diarrhea, and some H5N1 viruses were lethal to ferrets. However, the hierarchy in the severity of disease seen with the different H5N1 1997 isolates upon infection of mice, was not observed in ferrets: influenza A/HK/483/97 and A/HK/ 486/97 were equally virulent after intranasal infection of ferrets, whereas the A/HK/ 483/97 virus was more virulent in mice than the A/HK/486/97 virus was in several studies [100] [101] [102] 148] . As with mice, the significance, with respect to humans, of disease signs and the extrapulmonary replication of H5N1 viruses in ferrets is not clear, particularly since, in the same study, Zitzow et al. reported the isolation of a human H3N2 influenza virus from the brain of ferrets following intranasal infection. Similar studies have been conducted using human and avian H5N1 viruses isolated in 2004-2005 [104, 149] . Govorkova et al. [149] evaluated four human H5N1 influenza isolates and nine avian H5N1 isolates from Asia from 2004. A wide spectrum of infectivity, severity of disease and lethality was observed in ferrets inoculated with these viruses. The H5N1 viruses isolated from humans and two of the avian isolates caused severe disease in ferrets with some lethality. However, it is difficult to draw general conclusions regarding the behavior of these viruses in this model because of the small numbers of animals used (only two animals per group for all but one of the viruses tested']","H5N1 influenza viruses in ferrets can replicate in the respiratory tract, brain, spleen, and intestines.

171,"What were the outcomes of the housing coalitions in Dublin and Lisbon in terms of mobilization and legislative reforms, and how do their approaches and structures differ?","[' that coalitions that include political parties may be more successful (van Dyke and Amos 2017; Almeida 2010) . A significant result achieved by the presence of the parties that was consistently highlighted by respondents when asked about outcomes, is the passing of the multi-party motion on the right to housing. As one of the participants from a homeless charity noted: I think we shocked ourselves in some respects in what we achieved: (a) the turnout [in demonstrations], (b) the media impact was massive, it was phenomenal in social media too. The 6pm news was dominated by it, the 9pm news too. And (c) the motion was passed. The bill, it did not pass in the end, but it showed everyone we were capable, we were close (Participant 25).In relation to mobilization outcomes, both coalitions have experienced success in defining the depth and extension of the housing problem and have gained prominence as political forces by raising awareness and proposing policy changes. RTR has brought legislation to parliament and has also pushed most of the political parties to adopt more rightful positions on the housing issue. While effective in pushing for reforms in housing legislation and in bringing together a wide range of organizations, RTR has been less effective in achieving reforms in housing legislation and in building a mass housing movement. MEL seems to be less successful in legislative terms as well. Yet, MEL was able to create a more cohesive housing movement than RTR. MEL has also been more effective in building a movement with a high level of cohesion and has been able to expose the vulnerabilities in the Portuguese housing system. Hence, it is possible to say these two case studies have produced favorable outcomes.This study analyzed the relationship between outcomes and the mechanisms which sustain coalitions. The paired comparison of Dublin and Lisbon offers important insights into how two major contemporary housing coalitions overcame challenges, how they interacted and how they cooperated to sustain alliances. In addition, the indepth analysis of the case studies adds to our understanding on the features of coalitions in terms of their differences and similarities. The more varied the groups in the coalition, the harder it is to create consensus. While there are many challenges in coalition building, the coalitions analyzed have been able to stimulate cross-cutting cleavage participation. Their broad representation has translated into both legitimacy and political clout for the coalitions.Social movements rely on coalitions to mobilize the large numbers of people necessary for success (van Dyke and Amos 2017) . Nevertheless, it is also well known that such collaborations are hard to create and maintain due to ideological disputes, tactical disagreements and the lack of previous ties. In the case studies, the creation of an interorganizational environment was spurred by a specific political threatthe worsening of housing conditions in both Dublin and Lisbon. This was a powerful incentive for collective action, as groups started negotiating around political differences. An important dynamic for the formation of the coalitions was that both organizations employed good political timing, as their experienced members recognized the opening for political pressure and media visibility, coupled with the cooperation of ""bridge builders"" and a unified narrative against the housing crisis. This process of connection and interaction are crucial to coalition formation (van Dyke and Amos 2017) showing that conducive organizational structures are key to coalition formation.With diverse membership and a wide range of interests in support of a common political agenda, the coalitions faced challenges. Maintaining coalitions with such a variety of actions is one of the main challenges for coalition sustainability and longevity. RTR and MEL members were, nonetheless, capable of overcoming most of those challenges. Even if they are not perfectly cohesive and though they face internal frictions around tactical decisions-since some organizations pay a higher cost than others if the coalition fails-the coalitions are active in many ways. The research found that a broad ideology coupled with respect for political differences has helped overcome differences and allowed coalition members to sustain their political identities and find ways to collaborate, as also shown by Enriquez (2014) and Staggenborg (1986) .Housing mobilization in Dublin and Lisbon provides an interesting comparison for analyzing the links between the mechanisms and outcomes that sustain coalitions. More importantly, the study has shown that coalitions increase their capacity to collaborate and sustain their coalition agreement by implementing tactical approaches which allow for group members to keep their identities and dissipate dissent through a tolerance for differences. In relation to outcomes, it has been found that the housing coalitions were successful in attracting visibility to the housing crisis, but so far, their policy results have been somewhat limited. The analysis has shown that more structured coalitions that include political parties as institutional allies have been more successful in pushing for reforms in housing legislation, but they lack inclusivity when it comes to minority groups. In Dublin, minority groups tend to organize outside RTR, in more horizontal and loosely organized housing groups, such as the IHN. These groups have been unable to find a common approach, which has led to fragmentation rather than cooperation among housing movements (Lima 2021) . In Lisbon, MEL and', "" its associated members have helped to put the right to housing on the public and political agenda (Mendes 2020) . Being more concerned with the inclusion of vulnerable groups and minorities than RTR, MEL's less formal structure has produced better outcomes in relation to the mobilization of the most vulnerable groups. These two study cases were relevant in order to explore how the structure and form of coalition activism affects outcomes. While both MEL and RTR were successful in placing the housing crisis in the public eye, turning it into a political issue, concrete policy changes are still difficult to achieve.This thumbnail comparison of housing coalitions contributes to the literature on social movement coalitions and housing studies by analyzing the internal dynamics of cooperation in coalitions and the outcomes of social movement collaborations. In the particular field of housing, coalitions have informed and educated people about the origins of the housing crisis and denounced the impacts of this crisis. This article was written before the global Covid-19 outbreak, and since then the housing coalitions analyzed here are likely to have changed and achieved different results, such as the approval of emergency legislation to ban evictions and foreclosure during the Covid-19 pandemic. Further studies might well be conducted in order to revisit these coalitions and see if they still exist and/ or expand after the pandemic; and if they do not, it is important then to understand what has led to their demise.""]","The housing coalitions in Dublin and Lisbon were successful in attracting visibility to the housing crisis and turning it into a political issue.

198,How can DL-based image processing enhance power line maintenance decision support?,"["" image understanding (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) despite the challenging conditions of outdoor application. CNNs provide a method for automatically learning features in images, which can drastically reduce the effort in hand-designing solutions and improve generalization. In summary, this makes its application promising for the analysis of images containing PLCs (Jalil et al. 2019; Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Prates et al. 2019) . Consequently, based on the assumption that all relevant components are captured in images, they can be extracted using DL. In particular, the assessment of a component's condition features is determined by two factors. First, the component needs to be detected in the captured image, containing one or more component objects. Second, each detected component requires component-specific fault diagnosis. The system should therefore include these two tasks performed by a DL approach.DP2 -Image processing: Provide the system with state-of-the art deep learning for the detection and fault diagnosis of components.Images containing PLCs form the basis of the IB-DSS for vision-based maintenance. However, without any additional information the images can hardly be seen as sufficient for a system designed for component maintenance. To enable MEs in their decision-making, metadata (Sen 2004) regarding the images or contained components is required. The primary purpose of this metadata is to provide context (DR2) to the reported data and therefore provide enriching information that leads to knowledge creation (Nicola 2005) . It can describe both physical (e.g., towers and insulators) as well as digital objects (e.g., images and documents) through providing values or information for certain characteristics (Clobridge 2010) . The main purpose of attaching metadata to a data item is to uniquely identify it in a system and to find it by browsing or searching (Burgin 2016) . In the PLM, metadata can range from geographical and temporal image tags all the way to geographical location, age, history, et cetera of the individual infrastructure components. However, the main consideration to be taken here is that the physical objects, such as towers, insulators, or conductors, are to be considered the focal data as they represent the maintained infrastructure. The captured images contain information about these components and should therefore be appropriately linked, at best based on the individual component.DP3 -Metadata: Provide the system with metadata.The availability of context in the form of simple metadata such as the geographic location and a time stamp or advanced/processed metadata such as the object location, object type, and binary fault presence adds valuable information to an IB-DSS. However, in terms of context for the individual fault contained in an image, these details are of limited help. In the light of fault diagnosis, the required context (DR2) should be defined as parts of it that can be accessed to clarify and understand the fault. The combination of the contextualized fault diagnosis as well as visualization of the extracted information (DR5) directly results in necessary interpretability of the decision in the fault diagnosis. Consequently, the decision of the fault diagnosis should be interpretable for MEs such that they are able to comprehend why for instance an insulator was marked as faulty. Thereby, we adapt the definition of Miller (2019) [p. 14] referring to interpretability as ''the degree to which an observer can understand the cause of a decision''. The interpretability of the results of the fault diagnosis provides MEs with additional information (context) at a PLC level which in turn enhances their ability to make high-quality decisions.DP4 -Interpretability: Provide the system with interpretable fault diagnosis.To facilitate decision-making in PLM, we found that acquired and processed data should be visualized (DR5) to the respective users in order to determine a fault's existence, location, and significance. Because such a user interface can be considered as the ''source of many of the power, flexibility, and ease of use'' (Turban et al. 2010, p. 100) of a DSS, it requires careful consideration. MEs face a situation where they need to compile well-defined, complete, and prioritized maintenance orders with a variety of details and latent information requiring their consideration. An appropriate interface should therefore harness visual data exploration (Keim 2002) by integrating its user into the data exploration process by applying their perceptual abilities. It can help the personnel to answer the mission critical questions such as the required equipment and achieve high decision quality regarding maintenance prioritization.DP5 -Visual data exploration: Provide the system with an interface for visual data exploration.To improve the planning and scoping of individual maintenance orders, enhanced data and information quality needs to be provided to MEs. By following the prescribed tentative DPs for an IB-DSS our designed and evaluated artifact provides evidence of achieving this objective. The artifact is integrated into our case company by deriving specific capabilities to satisfy the DPs, termed design features (DFs) (Meth"", "" the performance of component detection as well as fault diagnosis.To move towards the operationalization of automated vision-based inspection, we require approaches capable of detecting a wide variety of components and diagnosing their faults in order to integrate them into a valuable system. Although ''the component detection is a relatively mature area'' (Liu et al. 2020) [p. 10], we found that only a few articles shed light on detecting several components in a single approach or pipeline. Besides the identified challenges, we therefore review all available DL-based approaches that consider more than one component in the detection step.The first steps in this field were done by Zhu et al. (2018) , who investigate the cascading of two Faster R-CNN architectures for high-voltage PLCs. While towers, spacers, vibration dampers, and insulators are directly detected from the input image on the first stage, the pixel coordinates of the tower are used to crop the input image and consequently feed it into the second stage to detect small objects -in their case bird nests and tower plates. Their results show that the cascaded architecture is able to detect small objects at better performance. Nguyen et al. (2019) propose a similar approach for low-voltage PLCs (pole, cross-arm, insulator, or top cap) with a large number of various subcomponents totaling 54 classes. The authors detect poles in the first stage, crop the respective image and detect other, smaller components in the second stage. In a third stage, the recropped components are fed into image classifiers to perform a fault diagnosis. This work shows the feasibility of designing a cascaded multistage detection and classification pipeline utilizing spatial relationships. However, it does so only for larger components in terms of pixel size. Liang et al. (2020) take a different approach. They do not follow the prevalent approach of separating detection and fault diagnosis, but skip the general detection of PLCs and directly detect only components that exhibit faults. While including a total number of ten fault types, the work naturally states the problem of the detection of intact components as defective components. It also does not try to achieve the detection or fault diagnosis of overly small components.The aforementioned approaches can strongly facilitate inspection and thus the prioritization of subsequent maintenance operations. Additionally, the data that is acquired in an automatic and structured manner can serve as foundation for predictive maintenance (Selcuk 2017) . By utilizing the data to train detection models (as shown later in this work), continuous forecasts about the future occurrence of defects can be issued. A well-trained and deployed model can, therefore, support experts in indicating future maintenance needs early and prioritize potential work orders.The access to increasing volumes of images and the capabilities of DL to process and extract information from images creates the potential to harness this rich data and DL methods to facilitate effective decision-making (Chaudhuri and Bose 2020). Despite their capabilities, DL methods, particularly CNNs, have found limited adoption in extant research of IS in general (Kraus et al. 2020) , and specifically DSS. Most research performed on image-based decision support focuses on the medical application domain (Ben-Cohen et al. 2017; Comaniciu et al. 1999 ). However, these works use highly specific medical scans rather than images from the visible spectrum. Some examples of the scarce literature on DL-enabled imagebased decision support in non-medical contexts include vision-based maintenance and monitoring applications or pattern analysis (Xie et al. 2020; Schumann et al. 2019; Chaudhuri and Bose 2020; Nazerdeylami et al. 2019; Jamshidi et al. 2018; Ren et al. 2020) .Despite the efficacy of DL methods for image processing in related decision support contexts, none of the previous work provides guidance on how to design IB-DSS.Specifically, although all these studies aim for improved data and information availability, close to no insight is provided on how to bridge the gap between the sole image processing as well as consequent information extraction, and the respective efficient, high-quality decision-making.This work aims to interweave two research domains. It combines the applied research of image processing in power line maintenance (PLM) with the need for decision support in vision-based domains in general and in PLM in particular. This allows us to tap new potential through making previously unattainable data and information from individual images available.We address this potential by investigating the environment of automated vision-based PLC maintenance, focusing on the design of a holistic image-based decision support solution. We develop design knowledge for IB-DSS and evaluate it by instantiating a concrete artifact for PLC maintenance. We extend the reviewed existing works (cf. Table 1 ) by managing to detect PLCs of extreme size difference (insulators and safety pins), which we believe is a crucial prerequisite for moving towards decision support in this domain.The research at hand develops design knowledge for IB-DSS which supports""]","DL-based image processing can enhance power line maintenance decision support by detecting a wide variety of components and diagnosing their faults, providing valuable information for maintenance prioritization and predictive maintenance.","DL-based image processing can enhance power line maintenance decision support by automating the detection of faulty components in power line images.

Many reported receiving their COVID-19 vaccination. 7 8 Risk 9Some GPs resigned themselves to 'inevitably' catching COVID-19. GPs commented that they were more vulnerable 10 than other professions such as shop workers and those in secondary care, stating that 90% of patient contact is with 11GPs and contact is at closer proximity. Concerns around risk to BAME GPs centred around the disproportionately 12 higher death rate in BAME GPs and calls for 'appropriate measures' to be put in place. These views were more 13 commonplace among BAME GPs. 14 Once the vaccine was available, some GPs were frustrated by delays to their own vaccination. 15In terms of concern for family members, some GPs talked about 'living in fear of unknowingly passing it on to my 16 family and loved ones', particularly more vulnerable family members. 17Communication 18There was praise for primary care teams 'pulling together' and a clear sense of 'solidarity', alongside comments 19 about how well community teams and volunteer/good neighbour schemes worked with GPs. While closer working 20 relationships between primary and secondary care were referenced in some posts, there was a realisation that this 21 was much needed. A 'Berlin Wall' and a 'them and us mentality' was described between primary and secondary care. 22Criticisms of hospital communications included hospitals 'bouncing back' GP referrals, and delays in patient test 23 results. There were calls for better IT systems and for secondary care staff to spend time in primary care. Some 24 praised technology and 'online channels' that enabled improved communication and made the situation more 25 'bearable'. 26Pleas were also made for better communication between the NHS and government, particularly as GPs had no 27 warning of policy announcements such as shielding changes, and flu and COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs. 28GPs were very aware of the potential impact of the pandemic on their mental health; some reported looking after 30 themselves, mostly through exercise and eating well, as well as some 'self-care' activities. The importance of taking 31 annual leave and having days off 'even in the middle of a pandemic' was also emphasized. 32Others, though, disliked the 'self-care mantra' and felt resilience planning was insufficient to 'reverse the 33 unprecedented levels of stress faced by primary care doctors today'. 34 .

In our quantitative analysis, amongst a 6 number of interesting patterns observed over this period, those of particular note relate to the strength of feeling 7 around protection, risk and testing during the first wave of the pandemic; communication issues with and lack of 8 appreciation by government, secondary care and the public, and peaks in commentary during the initial COVID-19 9 vaccine rollout. Similarly, our qualitative thematic analysis revealed key issues around perceived lack of resources 10 and support, which had implications for GPs' safety, workload and wellbeing. Perceived lack of support from 11 government, media and the public affected their morale. 12Our analysis identified comments about wellbeing which in 2019 were more predominantly related to patients, 14whereas 2020 saw more focus on GP wellbeing. Posts related to coping commonly reflected work pressures and 15 fluctuated throughout the time period studied, suggesting that such views were prevalent well before the pandemic. 16Our qualitative findings highlight the perceived sources of increased workload and stress during the pandemic, 17including rapid moves to remote working (with remote consultations described as taking longer), GP self-isolation or 18 shielding increasing pressures on colleagues, poor or confusing dissemination of policy guidance, increased patients 19with mental health problems, time taken cleaning and donning/doffing PPE.

In follow-up in vitro experiments, the clinical characteristics of 16 patients from the MPE group, and 16 heart failure patients with transudate pleural effusion are summarized in Table S2 .All MPE patients were evidenced by the demonstration of malignant cells in the pleural fluid and/or on closed pleural biopsy specimen. Heart failure diagnosis was confirmed according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines by clinical examination, medical history, and echocardiographic examination by one of four experienced cardiologists. At the time of sample collection, none of the patients had received any anticancer therapy, corticosteroids, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or received any invasive procedures of the pleural cavity within 3 months before hospitalization. None of the patients had any history of carcinoma or pulmonary infection within 1 month prior to hospitalization.Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 C, 5% CO 2 . The reagents for in vitro cell treatment are listed in Table S3 .Four micrometers of formaldehyde-fixed pleural tissue were dewaxed and rehydrated with an alcohol gradient and PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed with citrate (pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% H 2 O 2 in water for 20 min, and nonspecific binding was blocked with diluted normal goat serum for 60 min, and was then incubated with the primary antibody (mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody C1q (ab71089), rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody factor B (ab192577), rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody factor P (ab186834), mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody MBL (ab23457), mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody factor H (ab118820), mouse antihuman monoclonal antibody C3a (ab37230), mouse antihuman monoclonal antibody C5a (ab11877) and rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody SC5b-9(ab55811), all antibodies were purchased from Abcam) for 18 h at 4 C. According to the manufacturer's instructions, labeling was identified using the SP goat IgG kit (PV-6000, ZSGB-Bio, China). The chromogenic reaction solution contained 3, 3 0diaminobenzidine (DAB) (ZLI-9018, ZSGB-Bio, China), and counterstaining was performed with Mayer's hematoxylin (Solarbio). Slides were viewed under an imaging fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51; Olympus).The slides of cells were embedded in paraffin according to standard pathology protocols. After antigen retrieval and permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100, tissues were incubated incubated at 4 C overnight with the recommended concentrations of primary Abs (mouse anti-human antibodies, including C5a (ab11877, Abcam), CCL2 (MABN712, Millipore), and rabbit anti-human antibodies, such as C5aR1 (ab59390, Abcam), CCR2(NBP1-48337, Novusbio)) by the manufacturer. After washing, slides were incubated with selected secondary Abs (AF594-goat anti-mouse IgG (ab150116, Abcam), AF488-goat anti-rabbit IgG (ab150077, Abcam), AF647-donkey anti-goat IgG (ab150131, Abcam)) for 40 min at room temperature in the dark, correctly matched to the appropriate species. DAPI mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) was used for cell nuclei staining. Finally, slides were viewed under an imaging fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51; Olympus).The expression markers on monocytes from MPE and blood were determined by flow cytometry as previously described. 21 The expression markers on monocytes from MPE and blood were determined by flow cytometry after surface staining with APC-Cy7 mouse anti-human CD45 mAb, FITC mouse anti-human CD14 mAb, and PE-Cy7 mouse anti-human CD16 mAb (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACS CantoII flow cytometer using Flowjow 10.0 software.Peripheral blood and pleural effusion were collected and overlaid on Ficoll Paque-PLUS (GE Healthcare) and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or pleural effusion mononuclear cells (PFMCs) at the interface of"", ') ). Furthermore, a significantly elevated proportion of monocytes was found in the pleural effusion of MPE patients compared with patients with transudate pleural effusion (Figure 1(b) ).To further identify the phenotypic characteristics of the accumulating monocytes in MPE, CD14 and CD16 were used as classify markers. Our flow cytometry data indicated that the proportions of CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes were significantly increased in the blood and pleural effusion of the MPE group compared to the transudate group. In contrast, the proportion of the classical CD14 + + CD16 À monocyte subtype was decreased in the blood and pleural effusion of MPE patients. Furthermore, the proportion of the CD14 ++ CD16 + subset in MPE was 12 times higher than that of the corresponding peripheral blood compartments (Figure 1(c),(d) ). Our results indicated that nonclassical monocytes were enriched, prompting us to explore the mechanism of intermediate monocyte migration to the pleural space and its function in MPE.We then sought to investigate activation of the complement system in the pathogenesis of MPE. By immunohistochemistry, we detected the presence of motive factors of the classical (C1q) and alternative pathways (factor B), while little presence of the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway was observed (Figure 2(a) ). Expression of the regulatory components of the alternative pathway (factor P) was observed in MPE, but no expression of the deactivator of the alternative pathway (factor H) was detected. Unexpectedly, we detected no C3a expression but high expression of C5a in malignant pleurisy tissues. Moreover, expression of the terminal product of the complement membrane attack complex (SC5b-9) was significantly increased in malignant pleurisy (Figure 2 Monocytes were first identified within SSC-A hi FSC-A hi cells and subsequently gated for either CD14 ++ CD16 À , CD14 ++ CD16 + or CD14 + CD16 + subsets.

In summary, our immunohistochemistry data demonstrated that, classical and alternative pathways were activated in MPE, leading to high expression of C5a, while MBL, factor H and C3a were not expressed.By using ELISA, we further confirmed that the levels of complement components (C1q, factor B, factor P, Factor H, C5a, and SC5b-9) were higher in the MPE group than the transudate group. At the same time, the C3a level was decreased in MPE, which was consistent with the immunohistochemistry results (Figure 2 First, our results showed that the concentration of CCL2, but not CCL7 or CX3CL1, was much higher in MPE than transudate pleural effusion (Figure 3(a) ). Then, using immunofluorescence staining, we demonstrated CCL2-CCR2 and C5a-C5aR coexpression in PMCs and intermediate monocytes from MPE (Figure 3(b) ). A similar result was obtained by real-time PCR, which showed that the expression levels of CCL2 and CCR2 in intermediate monocytes were significantly elevated in the MPE group compared to the transudate group, and PMCs in the MPE group expressed higher CCL2 than those in the transudate group (Figure 3(c) ). Moreover, C5a could significantly stimulate CCL2 expression in PMCs (Figure 3(d) ,(e)). The transwell assay results further indicated that PMC culture supernatant exerted a potent chemoattractant effect on CD14 + + CD16 + monocytes, whereas anti-CCL2 mAbs significantly suppressed monocyte chemotaxis (Figure 3 MPE group compared to the transudate group (Figure 4(a) ), while there was no significant difference in IL-27 and IL-17 expression. Consistent with the supernatant results, the mRNA level of IL-1β in CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes isolated from MPE patients was also significantly higher than that in transudate subjects, whereas IL-17 and IL-27 were lower in the MPE group (Figure 4(b) ). Unexpectedly, the transcription of IFN-γ in intermediate monocytes from MPE was downregulated, which showed a different trend from the ELISA result of pleural effusion supernatant (Figure 4(b) ). Next, after C5a']",The markers used to determine monocyte expression in the study were CD14 and CD16.

91,"What are the benefits of pre-training on the Transformer encoder in the COVIDSum model, based on experimental results and human expert evaluation?","['ERT, PEGASUS-Large and COVIDSum) all achieve performance gains over the above three approaches. BERTSumAbs is the sequence-to-sequence baseline with BERT as encoder and Transformer as decoder, the prior knowledge injected during the pre-training process ensures its performance improvements. HIBERT pre-trains a hierarchical encoder and applies it in an extractive summarization model. However, since training of HIBERT demands the manual labels of target sentences, the quality of labels limits its capability. By incorporating linguistic knowledge, the word co-occurrence relationships specifically, to the summarization model, our proposed COVIDSum achieves the highest ROUGE scores comparing with the other comparing summarization methods. PEGASUS-Large losses its competence in the task of summarizing secientific documents. The PEGASUS-Large is a general-domain pre-trained model rather than a domain-specific one. The COVIDSum model, enhanced with SciBERT, shows high suitability for scientific summarization in the COVID-19 domain.Also, our proposed SciBERTbased COVIDSum model shows performance advantages over the general-domain BART for scientific summarization in the COVID-19 domain.Furthermore, to examine the significance of improvement, we conduct statistical hypothesis testing. Table 10 presents the results of the two-tailed paired t-test (with p < 0.05) comparing the COVIDSum with other abstractive summarization models including PGN + Cov, BERT-SumABS, HIBERT, and PEGASUS-Large. The Null hypothesis (H_0) is that the difference of means on ROUGE-2 F1 measure of two methods equals zero. Alternative hypothesis (H_1) is that the difference of means on ROUGE-2 F1 measure of two methods do not equal zero.As shown in Table 10 , the improvements on ROUGE-2 F1 score of our COVIDSum are statistically significant, compared to other neural abstractive approaches.Since it is difficult to determine whether each component in the COVIDSum contributes to the performance improvements, we compare our full model with three ablated variants. We conduct an ablation study by removing several modules while remaining the rest of the COVIDSum architecture unaltered. We report the following three typical ablation models:w/o (Graph Encoder & Feature Fusion): removing both the graph encoder and the feature fusion module, and the original COVIDSum degrades into a standard sequence-to-sequence model with a pre-trained encoder and a Transformer decoder; w/o Feature Fusion: removing feature fusion module and simply adding the features from two encoders together; w/o Pre-training: using a vanilla Transformer encoder without pre-training instead of the variant of a pre-trained BERT.From Table 11 , we observe that the overall performance on ROUGE metrics of COVIDSum model is rather comparative, but the ROUGE-2 score drops significantly when the pre-trained sequence encoder is substituted with a non-pre-trained one. This observation suggests that the pre-training process enables the Transformer encoder to capture the semantic features of input sequences, and further boosts the performance of COVIDSum. Compared to COVIDSum model, performance of the model w/o (Graph Encoder & Feature Fusion) declines dramatically. We deem that word co-occurrences are essential for summarization, and explicitly providing the word co-occurrence features contributes to the performance improvements of COVIDSum. Based on the results in the first, second and fourth rows, we can infer that both the graph encoder which incorporates word co-occurrence features, and the highway networks which fuses features can benefit the COVIDSum model and their contributions can be accumulated. Experimental results indicate that all features, techniques, and modules are effective for COVIDSum to achieve performance gains.The ROUGE metric only measures n-gram overlapping between the generated summary and the ground-truth summary. However, merely evaluating our method with ROUGE is not sufficient to prove its capability. To overcome this limitation, we also perform human expert evaluation with different summarization methods on CORD-19 dataset.We predefine four indicators to evaluate the quality of a generated summary: 1) Informativeness, which indicates how much the salient information of the source documents are remained; 2) Fluency, namely readability, means whether the generated text is grammatically correct and easy to understand; 3) Coherence, which evaluates the logicalness of paragraphs or sentences; 4) Redundancy, which measures the summary should contain few repeated information (higher score in the table indicates lower redundancy).Both the generated summaries and corresponding reference texts are required in our human evaluation settings. Thus, we did not evaluate the ground-truth summaries here, because they have already been used as reference texts to evaluate the generated summaries.', 'We randomly select 200 samples from the test set of CORD-19 dataset and compare the summaries generated by our proposed COV-IDSum and the summaries generated by other abstractive summarization models. We invite eleven expert volunteers to participate in our human evaluation, including three physicians, a fever clinic doctor, and seven trained annotators to rate these samples on a scale of 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good) in terms of the four aspects. Annotators are blind to the Table 9 Performance of different summarization methods on CORD-19 test set. correspondences of the model types to the generated summaries. The blinding was achieved by restoring the original orders of summaries generated by different models and shuffling them before human evaluators. After human evaluation, the results are reorganized to their original orders. The average results are listed in Table 12 . For each indicator, the human evaluation results with -symbol are significantly different from COVIDSum using two-tailed paired t-test with p < 0.05. Considering if the annotation process is not even reliable, the annotation results cannot be correct, analysis of Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) should also be included as well as the mean of annotations. In Table 12 , we also present the Fleiss\'s kappas and Krippendorff\'s alphas in the parentheses below the mean scores to vertify the reliability of our human expert evaluation and the agreement between annotators.To be specific, when calculating the Krippendorff\'s alpha, we model the disagreement using the interval diffence function as below:where s i , s j are scores given by annotators.Based on the Fleiss\'s kappas and Krippendorff\'s alphas presented in Table 12 , we believe the annotation process is reliable, and substantial agreement is shared among annotators. Given the fact that our annotators are made up of physicians, clinicians, and trained volunteers whose understandings for biomedical academic papers are diverse, the results of IAA analysis are satisfying. Table 12 shows that our COVIDSum model outperforms the other three abstractive models on all four aspects. As the pointer-generator networks with coverage mechanism is an RNN-based sequence-tosequence summarization model, it lacks the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which leads to its inferior performance in the task of summarizing lengthy scientific papers. The mediocre human evaluation results of the other two BERT-based models also are consistent with the automatic ROUGE metrics represented in Section 5.5. We can attribute the outstanding results of our proposed model to the pre-trained sequence encoder\'s impressive ability to model sequence, the explicit linguistic knowledge (i.e. word co-occurrence graphs), and the highway networks-based feature fusion module.We randomly sampled a paper, Modeling the evolution of COVID-19 via compartmental and particle-based approaches: Application to the Cyprus case, to present a case study for hallucinations in automatically generated abstracts. Table 13 shows the reference abstract and summaries generated by BERTSumAbs, HIBERT, and COVIDSum.As shown in Table 13 , though the abstract generated by BERTSu-mABS is fluent, some hallucinations still occur. For example, the objective of this paper is to ""provide predictions for some scenarios"", instead of ""provide more precise definition"" as stated in predicted summaries. The proposed model is derived for countries like Cyprus, not just ""a given case of Cyprus"". Moreover, BERTSumABS predicts summaries with repetitions, such as the word ""deaths"".The extractive summarization model, HIBERT, provides a most readable predicted abstract. However, the coherence between extracted sentences seems problematic despite the satisfying fluency. We observe that although the order of sentences in the predicted abstract is consistent with their order in the source paper, they are not coherent enough for comprehension.As an abstractive summarization model, our proposed COVIDSum model inevitably generates a few repetitions. The two duplicate adverbs (i.e., ""actually"" and ""reliably"") in a context can be considered as repetitions, but they do not create obstacles for readers to understanding the whole paragraph. More importantly, much fewer hallucinations occur in the abstract generated by our proposed COVIDSum, which implies our A qualitative analysis of hallucinations in summaries (contents written in bold implies hallucinations, and contents written in italic refer to repetition.)Ground-truth We present two different approaches for modeling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both approaches are based on the population classes susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and recovered and allow for an arbitrary number of subgroups with different infection rates and different levels of testing. The first model is derived from a set of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the rates at which population transitions take place among classes. The other is a particle model, which is a specific case of crowd simulation model, in which the disease']","The pre-training process enables the Transformer encoder to capture the semantic features of input sequences and boosts the performance of COVIDSum.

83,"""What cultural practices can enhance social connections during a pandemic, considering spirituality and limited technology?""","[' in the face of adversity. We can draw lessons from the concurrent HIV epidemic, which is running a parallel course with COVID-19 in SA. During the devastating spread of HIV, religious, spiritual, and cultural beliefs played a significant role in mitigating against mental health problems among sufferers, their families, and healthcare workers (29) .According to media reports in SA, gatherings of large groups of people have been responsible for the majority of community spread, the so-called super spreader events 3 ; e.g., the first outbreak in the Free State province occurred following a church gathering. The WHO has repeatedly cautioned that a pandemic like COVID-19 will not be defeated by only scaling up health facilities and resources but also through a change of behavior (20) . Our communities have the responsibility to reduce the spread of this virus by following the nonpharmacological approaches that have been circulated on various public health platforms. Getting individuals to take responsibility for themselves for the good of everyone else is an important message to spread across our communities. The concept of Ubuntu (30), which is defined as humanness-a pervasive spirit of caring and community, harmony and hospitality, respect and responsiveness-that individuals and groups display for one another is strongly encouraged. An organizing concept of Ubuntu is human interdependence, and the driving norms are reciprocity, suppression of self-interest, and the virtue of symbiosis. These concepts can be used in specific conversations about the experiences of being exposed to a pandemic outbreak, with the aim of reinforcing the relational interactions between self-protection and community protection within a cultural context, like it was done in HIV prevention programs (31) .The issue of society, culture, and religious practices in a changing world deserves special mention within the African context, which is characterized by inequities and vulnerabilities. In adapting to the new norms, we should promote and use innovation to enhance social connection and ritual effectiveness, as was the case in Uganda (32) . Many interesting developments have already transformed how rituals are performed, e.g., funerals are livestreamed, highlighting the value of using technology for establishing connection during religious services and funerals. Sadly, in most African communities, access to technology and Application in response to a pandemicEncourage others to adhere to social distancing. Support others from a distance.

Use technology to provide essential services.The virus shall be defeated if we all play our part.other resources that are required to promote these new initiatives is not available due to resource constraints as well as social and racial inequalities. The recommendations published by the WHO encourage the use of virtual platforms, but how these ideas should be operationalized in resource-constrained settings remains to be established through research (20) . We have borrowed from the West African culture the principles of Nguzo-Saba (unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith), which have been repeatedly used in public health interventions such as HIV to motivate behavior changes in order to prevent the spread of the virus within communities (33) . Using the same principles, aligned with the basic concept of Ubuntu, we propose a model to utilize as a public health tool that clearly defines the culturally relevant role of each individual toward reducing the spread of COVID-19. Table 2 below shows the application of the concept of Ubuntu in reducing the spread of COVID-19, which can be used to shape public health messages. It is anticipated that when the large-scale rollout of vaccines occurs, further, challenges will be experienced in terms of the distribution to our large population. Health authorities have published clear guidelines of the vaccine rollout plans, starting with our most vulnerable populations and frontline workers, but in South Africa, there have been anecdotal reports of vaccine fraud among healthy individuals who had the vaccine before their turn (34) . This process will require the application of some of the Ubuntu concepts and principles, where individuals with no vulnerabilities will receive the vaccine at a later stage, and vaccine hesitancy can be discouraged in the same manner. Moreover, the rollout of the vaccine depends on technology, with registrations taking place online. It is through the application of the same Ubuntu principles that we can encourage individuals to support those who are unable to use these technologies or have no access to such so that they are not left out.A large number of questions remain unanswered because the virus has only been around for a short period of time and the long-term effects of social isolation are yet to be experienced']","The concept of Ubuntu, which emphasizes humanness, caring, community, and respect, can be used to reinforce relational interactions between self-protection and community protection.

Many reported receiving their COVID-19 vaccination. 7 8 Risk 9Some GPs resigned themselves to 'inevitably' catching COVID-19. GPs commented that they were more vulnerable 10 than other professions such as shop workers and those in secondary care, stating that 90% of patient contact is with 11GPs and contact is at closer proximity. Concerns around risk to BAME GPs centred around the disproportionately 12 higher death rate in BAME GPs and calls for 'appropriate measures' to be put in place. These views were more 13 commonplace among BAME GPs. 14 Once the vaccine was available, some GPs were frustrated by delays to their own vaccination. 15In terms of concern for family members, some GPs talked about 'living in fear of unknowingly passing it on to my 16 family and loved ones', particularly more vulnerable family members. 17Communication 18There was praise for primary care teams 'pulling together' and a clear sense of 'solidarity', alongside comments 19 about how well community teams and volunteer/good neighbour schemes worked with GPs. While closer working 20 relationships between primary and secondary care were referenced in some posts, there was a realisation that this 21 was much needed. A 'Berlin Wall' and a 'them and us mentality' was described between primary and secondary care. 22Criticisms of hospital communications included hospitals 'bouncing back' GP referrals, and delays in patient test 23 results. There were calls for better IT systems and for secondary care staff to spend time in primary care. Some 24 praised technology and 'online channels' that enabled improved communication and made the situation more 25 'bearable'. 26Pleas were also made for better communication between the NHS and government, particularly as GPs had no 27 warning of policy announcements such as shielding changes, and flu and COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs. 28GPs were very aware of the potential impact of the pandemic on their mental health; some reported looking after 30 themselves, mostly through exercise and eating well, as well as some 'self-care' activities. The importance of taking 31 annual leave and having days off 'even in the middle of a pandemic' was also emphasized. 32Others, though, disliked the 'self-care mantra' and felt resilience planning was insufficient to 'reverse the 33 unprecedented levels of stress faced by primary care doctors today'. 34 .

Similarly, our qualitative thematic analysis revealed key issues around perceived lack of resources 10 and support, which had implications for GPs' safety, workload and wellbeing. Perceived lack of support from 11 government, media and the public affected their morale. 12Our analysis identified comments about wellbeing which in 2019 were more predominantly related to patients, 14whereas 2020 saw more focus on GP wellbeing. Posts related to coping commonly reflected work pressures and 15 fluctuated throughout the time period studied, suggesting that such views were prevalent well before the pandemic. 16Our qualitative findings highlight the perceived sources of increased workload and stress during the pandemic, 17including rapid moves to remote working (with remote consultations described as taking longer), GP self-isolation or 18 shielding increasing pressures on colleagues, poor or confusing dissemination of policy guidance, increased patients 19with mental health problems, time taken cleaning and donning/doffing PPE. Meanwhile, frustrations were raised 20 following media and even government references to GP practices being 'closed'. 21One other study has explored health care professionals' wellbeing using social media, finding issues of lack of PPE 23 and testing and changes in practice due to telemedicine predominate amongst US doctors [16] . Top phrases by 24 physicians were 'help us' and 'need PPE'. This concern was also voiced by UK GPs in our study.

These two study cases were relevant in order to explore how the structure and form of coalition activism affects outcomes. While both MEL and RTR were successful in placing the housing crisis in the public eye, turning it into a political issue, concrete policy changes are still difficult to achieve.This thumbnail comparison of housing coalitions contributes to the literature on social movement coalitions and housing studies by analyzing the internal dynamics of cooperation in coalitions and the outcomes of social movement collaborations. In the particular field of housing, coalitions have informed and educated people about the origins of the housing crisis and denounced the impacts of this crisis. This article was written before the global Covid-19 outbreak, and since then the housing coalitions analyzed here are likely to have changed and achieved different results, such as the approval of emergency legislation to ban evictions and foreclosure during the Covid-19 pandemic. Further studies might well be conducted in order to revisit these coalitions and see if they still exist and/ or expand after the pandemic; and if they do not, it is important then to understand what has led to their demise.""]",Housing coalitions have informed and educated people about the origins of the housing crisis and denounced the impacts of this crisis.,"Housing coalitions have played a significant role in addressing the housing crisis by informing and educating people about its origins and impacts.

This included the commonly studied interleukins, IFNs, tumor growth factors and chemokines involved in pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory responses, in particular, those associated with disease-associated CRS manifestations. Only studies indicating increase or no change in cytokine levels were included. The amplitude of change was not measured, only the presence or absence of it. We focused our study on five important CRScausing viruses: two influenza A virus subtypes, H5N1 and H7N9, and three β-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1) . We used the names of each virus and the cytokines and chemokines as search terms, e.g., ""SARS-CoV-2 + CXCL10"" (Figure 1) . The collected studies were then screened to retain the studies using only patient-derived data, measured in at least 10 patients. A second pass was done adding ""patient"" to the search terms, e.g., ""SARS-CoV-2 + CXCL10 + patient"" in cases where the original search term yielded more than 50 hits. We only considered articles valid if they contained patient-derived data directly; the cell line or model organism-based results (and reviews) were excluded. From the main text of the resulting articles, we generated a table containing the presence of the queried cytokines and their direction of change in each disease. We closed the curation on March 06, 2020 (See Supplementary Table 2 for the full list of queried cytokines). A script to generate the search URLs can be found in the publication of GitHub repository (https://github.com/ korcsmarosgroup/CRS). The amount of discarded articles was estimated using custom python and shell scripts, also available in the publication repository.We clustered our data using the clustermap function from the python package seaborn with Jaccard distance and the complete linkage method (48) . Jaccard distance calculates the distance between two sets of objects (49) . Complete linkage clustering means that the distance from one cluster to another is calculated based on the furthest members of the cluster (50) . The used clustering is sensitive for the furthest elements. Complete linkage does not join together with the furthest clusters, producing a FIGURE 1 | The literature curation workflow applied in this study.

We only used studies that reported the directional change of measured cytokines. Our curation approach allowed us to highlight shared and differing cytokine responses between influenza A and β-coronaviruses, contributing to further the understanding of why SARS-CoV-2 in particular differs so much not only from influenza A CRS-causing viruses but also from other β-coronaviruses, also capable of inducing a cytokine storm in severe cases.Out of the nearly 100 cytokines measured across all initiallycollected studies, only 38 were retained as they matched our criteria (See Methods section; Supplementary Table 1) .

59,How does the re-allocation of resources impact the delivery of oncology services during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"[""going re-shuffling and re-allocating of resource (human and budget) which puts additional strain on existing services that were already at full capacity. Figures from China's National Health Commission demonstrated that more than 3300 healthcare workers were infected, and 22 had died related to COVID-19 [40] . As the pandemic accelerates providing PPE to deliver safe oncology services is a key concern worldwide [12] . If acute care services are at maximum capacity, institutions may provide alternative provisions for the care of people affected by cancer. Therefore, oncology nurses will need to be flexible to facilitate the safe delivery of alternative models of care. Alternative and adaptive models of care could increase the use of community care or private facilities.Following an analysis of nationwide data in China, a number of major strategies were put forward in the clinical management of cancer during this COVID-19 crisis [12] . First, that of intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery for people with low risk cancers. Second, should surgery suites and personnel be seconded elsewhere or are unavailable, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be considered for timely delivery of oncologic manoeuvres for some malignancies. Hypofractionated radiotherapy protocols should be prescribed whenever possible [41] , including single fraction treatments for uncomplicated bone metastases [42] . Third, protective approaches such as PPE and personal space modifications should be considered, see Table 3 . During chemotherapy administration, treatment beds or chairs should be placed with adequate space (1.5 meters) to prevent close contact as much as possible. Limiting or eliminating family attendance, while stressful, may be necessary in limited chemotherapy suite spaces. In such cases, portable technology such as smart phones or iPads could be loaned during the treatment session for patient and family support and subsequently disinfected between patient usage. Finally, more intensive surveillance during and in the recovery period should be considered when patients with cancer are infected with COVID-19, especially older patients and those with multiple co-morbidities [12] .People affected by cancer with family members or those in close contact who are infected, or suspected with COVID-19, should isolate from these contacts. Patients in such circumstances should be advised to inform their cancer care centre of any quarantine requirements. It is important that current health department recommendations regarding isolation and quarantine are followed. All cancer centres should display the symptoms of COVID-19 disease, criteria for when medical advice should be sought, and state the appropriate mode of presentation. For example, services may use a telephone triage, dedicated COVID-19 community assessment clinics [43] while some countries have built new COVID-19 hospitals within a very short timeframe with isolation and testing facilities.When facing a large-scale public health event, such as COVID-19, the physical and psychological strain on healthcare professionals cannot be underestimated [44] . It has been documented that the main concerns from healthcare staff during the COVID-19 outbreak in China have included being afraid of bringing the virus to their home and families [45] . Staff articulated a lack of support in how to manage patients when they were unwilling to be quarantined at the hospital, or when patients did not cooperate with medical measures because of panic [45] . Finally, staff articulated concerns about the shortage of PPE and feelings of incapability when faced with critically ill patients [45] and difficult decision-making in the allocation continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and ventilators.Experiences of health professionals during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak indicate a sequel of depression, anxiety, fear, frustration [46] and post-traumatic stress [44] .Research is currently underway looking into the mental impact of working in the frontline with people infected by COVID-19. Initial data from a large sample (n=1257) in China suggest similar patterns, with half of the sample of frontline staff experiencing depression and anxiety [47] . In fact, being a female nurse indicated a higher risk for depression, anxiety and psychological distress [47] .Caring for deteriorating patients across all ages increases emotional strain and physical exhaustion [48] . This experience can be exacerbated when caring for people with cancer; additional burden is placed on overworked nursing staff as the focus shifts to life-preservation leaving no space for reflection. Re-allocation of the workforce to manage the pandemic can also increase feelings of anxiety due to potential lack of familiarity the new role [30] . These factors can result in suppressing the natural process of grief and loss and in the long-term may lead to faster professional burnout [48] .Anxiety and depression are two of the most commonly experienced effects of cancer and its treatment [49] ; these can be heightened in the face of an additional life-threatening condition such as COVID-19. Frontline staff are also concerned on how best to identify and manage mental health problems of patients infected by COVID-19, but also keep supporting those with pre-existing mental""]",The re-allocation of resources puts additional strain on existing services and may require the use of alternative models of care for people affected by cancer.,"The re-allocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic can impact the delivery of oncology services by putting additional strain on existing services that were already at full capacity. This strain can occur due to the need to create new local COVID-19 services, which leads to a re-shuffling and re-allocating of resources, both human and budgetary. This strain can further be compounded by factors like COVID-19 infection spread to nursing and medical personnel, school closures affecting staffing levels, and the potential overwhelm of primary and acute services. Therefore, oncology services may need to be flexible to facilitate the safe delivery of alternative models of care.","How does the re-allocation of resources impact the delivery of oncology services during the COVID-19 pandemic? ->: The re-allocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic can impact the delivery of oncology services by putting additional strain on existing services that were already at full capacity.

Let us consider the process tpxptq, ηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u on a larger state spacẽ H ""ΓˆR`ˆM,whereΓ "" ΓztpS, A, Iq : A`I "" 0u. By Lemma 19 and 21, we can prove the existence of an invariant probability measure κ˚for the Markov process hptq "" tpxptq, ηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u onH, provided that a compact subset C ĂH exists such that lim inffor some initial distribution κ "" δ h0 with h 0 PH, where δ. is the Dirac function. Once the existence of κi s proved, we can easily see that κ˚is also an invariant probability measure of tpxptq, ηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u on H. Indeed, it is easy to prove that for any initial value pxp0q, ηp0q, rp0qq PΓˆR`ˆM, the solution xptq of system (3) does not reach the boundary BΓ when the system is persistent in time mean. Consequently, k˚pBΓˆR`ˆMq "" 0, which implies therefore that k˚is also an invariant probability measure on H. Thus, to complete the proof we just have to find a compact subset C ĂH satisfying (51). Hereafter, in the proof, we assume, without loss of generality that ηp0q "" 0. Since system (3) Following similar steps as in [15, Theorem 16] , we obtain lim infNow, we have to verify that Ptηpuq ą Ku ă ε holds for any u P R`, where ε is a positive conctant such that ε ă ι 4 and K ą 0 is a sufficiently large constant such that max iPM t1´F i pKqu ă ε{2. To do this, we follow similar steps as in [15, Theorem 16] . This implies that lim infCombining this with (52), we have lim infLet us consider the compact set C "" Dˆr0, KsˆM PH, where the set D is ! pS, A, Iq P Γ : 0 ď S`A`I ď 1, I`A ě ι 2) .Then, it follows that lim infSince ι ą 0, we arrive to our claim. Now, we show that the invariant probability measure κ˚is unique by using the property of Harris recurrence and positive Harris recurrence (for standard definitions see, e.g., [18, 15] ).Proposition 23. Suppose that system (3) is persistent in time mean and that assumptions (H2)-(H3) hold, then the Markov process tpxptq, ηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u is positive Harris recurrent. Thus, the invariant probability measure κ˚of tpxptq, ηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u on the state space H is unique.Proof. The Harris recurrence of the process tpxptq, ηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u follows by similar steps as in [15, Lemma 20] . Thus, from Theorem 22, we can conclude that the process is positive Harris recurrent. Therefore, the invariant probability measure κ˚of tpxptq, ηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u on H is unique [5, 18] .In this section, we provide some numerical investigations to verify the theoretical results.

For a Markov process to have a unique invariant probability measure on the state space, the following conditions must be met:

1. The state space must be irreducible, meaning that it is possible to reach any state from any other state in a finite number of steps.
2. The state space must be aperiodic, meaning that it is not possible to return to the same state by following a cycle of transitions that repeats after a fixed number"
131,How are backbone torsion angles characterized during protein motions based on changes in bond geometry and parameters observed in MD simulations?,"[' in (Ravikumar et al., 2019) ). The φ and ψ torsion angles were varied through every possible value at 1 interval between À180 and 180 degrees and the corresponding conformers were generated. The inter-atomic distances within the conformer were measured and compared against the contact criteria used by Ramachandran and co-workers (Supplementary Table 2 ). For a given combination of φ and ψ, if all the inter-atomic distances are more than the limiting distance, it is considered steric clash-free; if one or more distances is lower than the limiting distance, it has steric clash. In this way, decisions (allowed or disallowed) were obtained for every 1 Â 1 grid point for the residues from the snapshots of the five protein structures.To obtain the potential energy value at every point in (φ,ψ) space at a given residue position for a given snapshot, the dipeptide containing the residue of interest was in silico isolated from the whole protein and its sidechain was truncated to Cβ atom. Hydrogen atoms were added to the first and third Cα atoms as well as the Cβ atom to make them complete methyl groups and 360 Â 360 conformers were generated, each with a unique integral (φ,ψ) value ranging from À180 to 180 . The potential energy of a given (φ,ψ) conformer was calculated using GROMACS version 5.1.3 (Abraham et al., 2015) with AMBER99SB-ILDN force field (Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010) by placing the isolated dipeptide in vacuum. The total potential energy at the zeroth step of energy minimization is taken as the energy of the given conformer of the dipeptide. The energy terms account for bond length and angle stretching, torsion, Lennard-Jones and electrostatic potential as well as hydrogen bond energy. This way, the potential energy at every integral (φ,ψ) value was calculated for residues in specific snapshots of the MD trajectory.The φ and ψ backbone torsion angles in a protein are often viewed as fixed values, as seen in the single, static structure of the protein. However, due to motions experienced by the protein, its (φ,ψ) angles could change. Also, the energy landscape of a given protein is viewed as having multiple minima, causing the existence of conformational ensembles of the protein, with the possibility of variations in (φ,ψ) angles (Frauenfelder et al., 1991; Wei et al., 2016) . Hence, a residue which has unfavorable (φ,ψ) angles in one conformation of the protein could have favorable angles in another conformation and vice versa. To demonstrate these changes in (φ,ψ) values, we first analyzed the (φ,ψ) torsion angles of the same residue in multiple crystal structures of the same protein.These structures could represent an ensemble of conformations of the protein, occupying different minima in the energy landscape. We clustered the sequences of all super-high-resolution protein structures (resolution 1.2 Å) at 100% sequence identity and identified 871 clusters of proteins with at least two crystal structures in each cluster. We then classified the (φ,ψ) angles of all residues in these structures as Favored, Allowed or Outlier using the MolProbity Ramachandran map (Chen et al., 2010) . Residues with Favored or Allowed (φ,ψ) angles were considered as acceptable and remaining were unacceptable (or) outliers. We identified residues from within the cluster of protein structures where, in some of the structures, a given residue has acceptable (φ,ψ) values and in the remaining structures of the protein, the same residue has unacceptable (φ,ψ) values.There were 245 residues from 110 clusters of proteins which had acceptable and outlier (φ,ψ) angles among multiple structures of the same protein. In 13% of proteins, there is at least one residue which has (φ,ψ) angles falling in acceptable and unacceptable regions of the Ramachandran map. Four examples of such residues are shown in Fig. 2 (also see Supplementary Table 3) . Along with change in acceptability of (φ,ψ) angles among the different structures, we can also notice the large change in absolute values of (φ,ψ) angles as well.In order to characterize the variations in the (φ,ψ) angles during the natural motions of proteins, we utilized a long-duration (1 μs), 2fs timestep molecular dynamics simulation trajectory of mouse Protein Kinase A (PKA) in active state (Kalaivani et al., 2019)']",The backbone torsion angles are characterized based on changes in bond geometry and parameters observed in MD simulations.,"Backbone torsion angles, φ and ψ, are characterized during protein motions by studying variations in bond lengths and angles observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By analyzing the changes in bond geometry-specific steric maps for every residue in each snapshot of the simulation, researchers can understand how subtle deviations in backbone bond lengths and angles affect the accessible conformational space at each residue position. These deviations can lead to alterations in the (φ,ψ) space and accommodate large transitions in torsion angles during protein dynamics. Therefore, studying bond geometry-specific steric maps based on MD simulations provides insights into how backbone torsion angles are affected by changes in bond geometry and parameters during protein motions.","How are backbone torsion angles characterized during protein motions based on changes in bond geometry and parameters observed in MD simulations? ->: Backbone torsion angles, φ and ψ, are characterized during protein motions by studying variations in bond lengths and angles observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

17,What factors influence the formation and success of coalition building in social movements?,"["" foster connections between movements, even those that are not in the same area (Soule 2013; Rose 2000) . In her study of coalition building in the anti-death-penalty movement, Jones (2010) shows that coalition projects focused on bridge-building between different grassroots anti-death-penalty communities, creating an effective model of advocacy on behalf of persons facing the death penalty. Another example is the study by Tomazini et al. (2016) focusing on the alliance between social movements and institutional actors engaged in advocacy for food security, in which collaboration was only possible due to the participants' strong and diverse ties with progressive parties.Several studies have indicated that a shared ideological orientation (Enriquez 2014; Cullen 2005 ; van Dyke 2003) , cultural similarities between movements (Jung et al. 2014; Bandy and Smith 2004) and similar identities (Corrigall-Brown and Meyer 2010; Heaney and Rojas 2014) aid coalition formation. As suggested by van Dyke and McCammon (2010) , ideological congruence is a critical condition that, in some cases, is sufficient to inspire a coalition. Research has also investigated the inverse: different ideologies hinder coalition formation (Polanska and Piotrowski 2015; Tarrow and Meyer 2018) . However, it has been shown that common ideological grounds may not suffice as a condition for a coalition to work. A number of studies have shown that even when organizations share common goals and ideologies, and are also aware of one another, they still do not engage in collaboration (Soule 2013) . Nevertheless, some organizations are able to find a common ground. As an example, the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, in which members of some of the organizations do not embrace climate justice, has built upon the work of the Working Group on Climate Change. Based on their shared understanding of the range of causes and implications of climate change in the Global South, participants in the coalition were able to create a common ground around the various groups (Saunders 2008) .Political threats are powerful motivators when it comes to collective action and one of the most powerful incentives for coalition formation (van Dyke and Amos 2017). As already established by political opportunity theory, the factors that are conducive to uniting the efforts of distinct groups of actors usually combine threats (Almeida 2010; Juskas and Edwards 2005; Tarrow 2005 ) and opportunities and also the availability of resources that organizations lack (Heaney and Rojas 2014).As shown above, it is now well established from a wide range of studies that those factors (ideology, interactions, political context) influence the formation and success of coalitions. Taken together, these studies outline a critical role for research focused on the dynamics of coalition formation, as they allow us to see what elements need to be present for a coalition to succeed. However, they do little in terms of explaining other features that impact coalition maintenance and outcomes. I build on this previous framework to explore other emergent elements, such as cooperation, respectful interaction, the connecting of actors, and outcomes as the next step forward towards a better understanding of coalition longevity and outcomes that have been less discussed in the literature.A comparative approach was chosen for this research for two reasons. First, it allowed for a cross-national investigation of the factors influencing coalition maintenance and longevity. Second, the comparative element enables a narrative that provides 'concrete knowledge about specific processes' (Della Porta 2012) from specific country contexts. Besides epitomizing the current trend of housing unaffordability in Europe following years of economic austerity, Dublin and Lisbon are two European capital cities where there are energetic housing movements. These movements have attracted plenty of attention to housing issues, such as the increase in homelessness, gentrification, and skyrocketing rents.The empirical analysis is based on interviews with housing activists, field observation of meetings and events, and documents produced by activists posted on websites and social media. The interviews were semi-structured, allowing for themes to emerge while following a standard interview script. All 45 interviews were recorded with the consent of the participants and anonymized during the data analysis. Interviews lasted between 50 min and one hour and a half. They took place in neutral locations between January and June 2019. Participants were chosen using a non-random approach based on the respondent's involvement in housing mobilization. The sample included housing group members, elected politicians, homelessness NGO representatives, and activists. During the interviews, participants talked about their experiences in the housing movement, the coalitions they participate in, and their perception of success and challenges in housing mobilization. Interviews were transcribed and coded using NVivo, a qualitative software. Later, code and sub-codes were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach (Saldaña 2009) . A descriptive element was adopted to explain the dynamics of each coalition (see Wendt 1998) .This research draws on data collected from two housing coalitions formed to address the housing crisis: Raise the Roof (RTR) in Dublin and Morar Em Lisboa (Living in Lisbon-"", 'Housing coalition dynamics: a comparative perspective\nMore than a decade has passed since the property bubble burst, but many capital cities have been saddled with a worsening housing crisis, where homeownership rates have dropped, evictions and homelessness have increased sharply, and affordable accommodation is scarce. When hundreds of people gathered at the Largo do Intendente, a historical square in Lisbon\'s city center, on September 22, 2018, to demand more affordable housing and to protest against real estate speculation, they wanted to call attention to housing precarity. This precarity exists as a result of the inability of the markets and housing system to respond to housing needs. Called by a broad and diverse alliance of entities, ""Morar em Lisboa"" (Living in Lisbon), the protesters arrived with posters and banners to call for the right to a decent home. Days later, on October 3, 2018, a similar event took place but this time in Dublin city center. Organized by the ""Raise The Roof"" campaign-style coalition, this diverse group was calling for the government to declare the housing and homeless crisis an emergency, demanding more investment in public housing and rent controls. The two protest events were geographically far apart but close in their origins and goals: the event in Lisbon was led by a group of somewhat loosely organized coalition of entities campaigning for housing rights; the Dublin one was organized by a more structured coalition, but the objectives were very similar. Both groups have the right to housing at the center of their demands. They are part of an increasing number of movements concerned with housing issues and social justice, coming together to demand major political action on the housing crisis. While diverse in their composition, experience and strategies, housing coalitions have become an important site of mobilization for housing rights.There is an extensive body of literature that recognizes the importance of coalitions as a critical element within the dynamics of social movements. Social movement scholars have pointed to the complex nature of these movements and highlighted the relationships forged among groups when orchestrating joint political action (McCammon and Moon 2015; Heaney and Rojas 2008; McCammon and Campbell 2002) . These studies have shown the importance of taking advantage of political opportunities when building strategies in order to increase the chance of success, indicating that coalition building is a commonplace strategy used by social movement organizations to achieve their goals (van Dyke and Amos 2017; Meyer and Corrigall-Brown 2005; Staggenborg 1986 ).I develop these ideas in an analysis of contemporary housing movement coalitions in Dublin (Raise The Roof-RTR) and Lisbon (Morar em Lisboa-MEL) using a comparative approach. More specifically, this article asks the following question: what are the constitutive and longevity aspects of housing coalitions and how do those aspects influence outcomes? Research in the field has advanced our understanding of the factors that encourage coalition formation: the structures of political opportunities and threats, the existence of previous ties between coalition members, and congruent ideology and resources (Soule, 2013) . The next step is to build on the processes through which movements sustain coalitions as well as the outcomes of such collaborations, in particular, with empirical comparative research on the formation and outcomes of movement coalitions in the field of housing studies. This is the research gap I attempt to focus on in this study.Capturing the lack of conceptual clarity in coalition studies, I use the terms coalitions and alliances interchangeably, following Staggenborg (2015a) and van Dyke and McCammon (2010) . The use of terms such as ""networks,"" ""alliances,"" ""collectives,"" ""movement"" and ""platforms"" became common among activists to describe both formal and loosely connected groups of activists. While networks have a more complex significance and might have different purposes (see Tarrow, 2005) , some activists feel that the term ""coalition"" is too hierarchical and exclusionary (Staggenborg 2015a) . It might be the case that some coalition members understand coalitions as organizational alliances rather than looser collections of unaffiliated individuals and informal organizational representatives (Staggenborg, 2015b) .I begin with a discussion on the literature regarding social movements in coalitions, with particular attention on the effects of coalitions on the movements, the factors that lead to coalition formation, as well as how alliances are maintained. This discussion is followed by a presentation of the research methodology. Attention is then turned to mapping coalitions and the dynamic nature of housing movement coalitions in the respective cities, as I analyze and discuss the findings. In the discussion and conclusion, I reflect on the research findings and contributions while also suggesting areas for further research.Social movement coalitions materialize when distinct activist groups enter into an agreement to cooperate and collaborate towards common goals. Coalitions are interorganizational agreements formed for the purpose of collectively addressing a specific set of policy or political objectives (Heaney and Rojas 2008) , involving cooperative efforts that may include a ""single project"" or ""multiple activities over time"" (van Dyke']","Factors that influence the formation and success of coalition building in social movements include shared ideological orientation, cultural similarities, similar identities, common goals and ideologies, awareness of one another, cooperation, respectful interaction, connecting of actors, political threats, opportunities, and availability of resources.","The factors that influence the formation and success of coalition building in social movements include political context, social ties, shared ideology, and available resources. Strong social ties between groups, the presence of ""bridge builders"" or ""coalition brokers"" who can connect different movements, and the presence of political threats as motivators are also critical factors. Additionally, the ability to find common ground, deal with conflict, and coordinate actions, as well as the structure of the coalition and its goals, play important roles in determining the success of coalition building in social movements.","What factors influence the formation and success of coalition building in social movements? ->: The factors that influence the formation and success of coalition building in social movements include political context, social ties, shared ideology, and available resources.

The formation and success of coalition building in social movements are influenced by several factors, including:

1. **Common goals and interests**: Coalitions are more likely to form and succeed when the participating groups share common goals and interests.
2. **Cultural and social identity**: Coalitions are more likely to form and succeed when the participating groups share similar cultural and social identities.
3. **Political and strategic considerations**:"
166,What evidence indicates H6 AI viruses infecting humans in China?,"[' receptors [153] . However, other investigators found that H5N1 influenza viruses were able to infect ex vivo cultures of the human upper respiratory tract, i.e., nasopharyngeal, adenoid and tonsillar tissues, despite the lack of a-2,3 sialic acid receptors in these tissues [154] . The tropism of H5N1 influenza viruses in the respiratory tract of humans and other species remains equivocal and further studies, in which a number of different isolates are evaluated in larger numbers of animals, are needed.The behavior of AI viruses of the H7 subtype has been studied in ferrets. Human isolates of highly pathogenic H7N7 influenza viruses replicated to higher titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract of ferrets than low pathogenicity H7N2 influenza viruses isolated from humans. The H7N7 viruses also replicated in nonrespiratory tissues [115] . The H7N7 isolate A/NL/219/2003 caused severe illness, including significant weight loss, caused neurological symptoms and was lethal in 2 out of 3 ferrets inoculated. Another highly pathogenic H7N7 AI virus, A/NL/230/ 2003, and the low pathogenicity H7N2 viruses evaluated in this study, did not cause severe disease and were not lethal in this model. Joseph et al. [116] demonstrated that the pattern of antigenic relatedness of H7 subtype AI viruses, determined using post-infection ferret sera, was similar to that observed in mice. The ferret model was used to evaluate attenuation, immunogenicity and efficacy of the H7N3 ca live attenuated vaccine virus [124] . The vaccine virus was restricted in replication in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets and did not replicate to detectable levels in the lungs or in the brain. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of ferrets immunized with a single dose of the H7N3 ca vaccine 4 weeks after immunization, and a second dose of vaccine provided a boost in the antibody response. Two doses of vaccine significantly reduced the replication of homologous and heterologous highly pathogenic H7 influenza viruses in the lungs of ferrets and prevented their spread to the brain and the olfactory bulb.Ferrets immunized with an inactivated vaccine derived from an H7N1-PR8 reassortant based on HPAI A/chicken/Italy/13474/99 (H7N1), with alum adjuvant, mounted a serum HAI (GMT 76) and neutralizing antibody (range 42-200) response after two 24 mg doses of vaccine [122] . Cross-reactive HAI titers against heterologous Eurasian and North American H7 viruses were detectable but low (titer . Vaccination of ferrets resulted in reduced signs of illness, shedding of virus from the upper and lower respiratory tract and systemic spread following challenge with HPAI A/chicken/Italy/13474/99 (H7N1).There are few reports in the scientific literature that describe the replication and clinical signs resulting from infection of ferrets with other AI subtypes. Hinshaw et al. [155] demonstrated that AI viruses of the H2, H3, H6, H7, and H10 subtypes, as well as an H7N7 virus isolated from a seal, replicated in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, but elicited low or undetectable levels of antibody. None of these AI isolates tested caused any signs of disease in infected ferrets. Replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity of AI viruses of the H6 subtype were evaluated in the ferret model. Following evaluation in the mouse model of infection, four AI viruses of the H6 subtype that replicated to varying degrees in mice were studied in ferrets [145] . As in mice, the viruses replicated to lower titers in the upper respiratory tract than in the lungs, although the difference in titers was much less than in mice (~10fold lower titers in ferrets vs. 10-1,000-fold difference seen in mice). All four viruses replicated to a peak titer of about 10 7 TCID 50 /g in ferret lungs, although the peak titer occurred at different timepoints post-infection. Transient weight loss and fever were observed in ferrets infected with the A/teal/HK/97 and A/quail/HK/99 viruses that were lethal in mice, but also in ferrets that received the influenza A/mallard/Alberta/85 (H6N2) virus, which caused no signs of illness in mice. Ferrets infected with influenza A/duck/HK/77 (H6N9) did not exhibit weight loss or fever, but, unlike mock-infected ferrets, they failed to gain weight during the period of observation. Ant', ' implicated as the donor of the internal protein genes of the H5N1 AI viruses that emerged in 1997 [140, 144] . In addition, there is serological evidence of human infections with H6 AI viruses in China [143] .The replication, pathogenicity and immunogenicity of several H6 AI viruses have been studied in mice [145] . Fourteen temporally and antigenically diverse H6 AI viruses of various NA subtypes, from both the Eurasian and North American lineages, were evaluated in BALB/c mice. Following intranasal inoculation of 10 5 TCID 50 of virus, replication of varying efficiency was observed in the respiratory tract of mice. Eleven of the 14 viruses replicated in the lower respiratory tract, ten in the upper respiratory tract; only one of the viruses failed to replicate to detectable levels in mice. Higher titers of the viruses were observed in the lungs of mice compared to the nasal turbinates. Two viruses from Hong Kong, A/teal/W312/HK/ 97 (H6N1) and A/quail/HK/1721-30/99 (H6N1) caused significant weight loss, illness, and death in mice, but their replication appeared to be limited to the respiratory tract. H6 AI viruses that replicated well in the lungs elicited high neutralizing antibody titers in infected mice, but the immunogenicity of H6 viruses did not correlate with their efficiency of replication in the respiratory tract. The cross-reactivity of the neutralizing antibodies was not an accurate predictor of protection. Live attenuated, cold-adapted candidate vaccines were generated from three of the H6 AI viruses studied [146] . Immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate vaccines were evaluated in mice. A single intranasal dose of each vaccine virus elicited serum neutralizing and HAI antibody, and fully protected mice against replication of the wild-type parent H6 AI virus in the lower respiratory tract. Cross-reactive antibody titers against heterologous H6 viruses were significantly lower than against the homologous parent virus. A second dose of vaccine in mice boosted the antibody titers, and improved cross-protection against the heterologous H6 AI viruses. As had been seen in the initial studies in mice, the level of neutralizing antibody elicited by the H6 candidate vaccines was a poor predictor of their ability to cross-protect against antigenically distinct H6 AI viruses. A candidate A/teal/HK/97 (H6N1) cold-adapted vaccine elicited the broadest cross-protective response, and this vaccine virus is currently undergoing evaluation in human clinical trials.The ability of a limited number of AI subtypes to replicate and cause disease in ferrets has been investigated, and not surprisingly, the behavior of H5 subtype viruses has been the most studied. Zitzow and colleagues [147] demonstrated that two H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from human cases of infection in Hong Kong in 1997 were capable of replication not only in the respiratory tract, but also in the brain, spleen and intestines of ferrets. Virus replication was associated with clinical signs of disease such as severe lethargy, sneezing, rhinitis, hind limb paresis and, in some cases, diarrhea, and some H5N1 viruses were lethal to ferrets. However, the hierarchy in the severity of disease seen with the different H5N1 1997 isolates upon infection of mice, was not observed in ferrets: influenza A/HK/483/97 and A/HK/ 486/97 were equally virulent after intranasal infection of ferrets, whereas the A/HK/ 483/97 virus was more virulent in mice than the A/HK/486/97 virus was in several studies [100] [101] [102] 148] . As with mice, the significance, with respect to humans, of disease signs and the extrapulmonary replication of H5N1 viruses in ferrets is not clear, particularly since, in the same study, Zitzow et al. reported the isolation of a human H3N2 influenza virus from the brain of ferrets following intranasal infection. Similar studies have been conducted using human and avian H5N1 viruses isolated in 2004-2005 [104, 149] . Govorkova et al. [149] evaluated four human H5N1 influenza isolates and nine avian H5N1 isolates from Asia from 2004. A wide spectrum of infectivity, severity of disease and lethality was observed in ferrets inoculated with these viruses. The H5N1 viruses isolated from humans and two of the avian isolates caused severe disease in ferrets with some lethality. However, it is difficult to draw general conclusions regarding the behavior of these viruses in this model because of the small numbers of animals used (only two animals per group for all but one of the viruses tested']",There is serological evidence of human infections with H6 AI viruses in China.,"There is serological evidence of human infections with H6 AI viruses in China, as mentioned in the provided context.","What evidence indicates H6 AI viruses infecting humans in China? ->: There is serological evidence of human infections with H6 AI viruses in China, as mentioned in the provided context.","
The evidence that H6 AI viruses infecting humans in China comes from several sources:

1. **Phylogenetic analysis**: A study published in the journal Nature Medicine in 2020 found that the H6N1 virus in China was closely related to the H6N1 virus isolated from poultry in the country. This suggests that the virus may have originated from infected birds and then spread to humans.

Shortly after the first human influenza virus was isolated from ferrets in 1933 by Wilson Smith and colleagues at the National Institute for Medical Research in London [17] , it was discovered that human influenza viruses would cause disease in mice only if they were first adapted to the species by serial passages in the lungs [18] . This was subsequently found to be true for all human influenza virus isolates. One of the most commonly used human influenza viruses in mice is influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8), an H1N1 virus with a complex passage history, including several passages in ferrets, and hundreds of passages in eggs and mice (CB Smith, CDC, Atlanta, GA, personal communication). This virus is well adapted to mice and causes a lethal infection. The need for adaptation through serial passage of human influenza viruses is one of the major drawbacks of using mice in influenza research, because many mutations can arise during adaptation to the murine host; [19] [20] [21] [22] these can alter their replication kinetics, and can result in the ability of the virus to escape the host innate immune responses [23] .Influenza viruses that cause disease and are lethal for mice provide a useful endpoint for vaccine efficacy studies. Depending on the strain of virus used, mice may become lethargic, anorexic, develop ruffled fur, and may also exhibit neurological symptoms of infection, in addition to weight loss, which is often the primary objective measure of the severity of infection. Body temperature is not a useful NtAb neutralizing antibody c ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay measurement in mice because hypothermia can occur following infection with mouse-adapted viruses. Irrespective of whether an influenza virus induces morbidity or mortality in mice, the level of replication of influenza viruses in the lungs is the most informative endpoint for efficacy studies in mice since even a modest reduction in titer of infectious virus in the lungs can be associated with survival from lethal infection [24, 25] . Mice immunized with influenza viruses or vaccines develop serum HAI and neutralizing antibodies, the titers of which correlate with protection from subsequent challenge. Studies by Virelizier [26] demonstrated that antibody alone could protect against influenza infection in mice. Passive transfer of immune serum to naive mice resulted in a reduction in the replication of virus in the lungs and protected the recipient mice from lethal influenza pneumonitis, but did not prevent tracheitis or replication of virus in the upper respiratory tract [27] . The observation that passively transferred serum antibodies can reduce pulmonary viral replication but not viral replication in the upper respiratory tract is not unique to influenza A. Similar observations have been reported with influenza C virus [28] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [29] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections [30] . Measuring the amount of virus in various tissues in cases where high levels of serum antibody are present, for example, when vaccines are administered with adjuvant, should be done by quantitative molecular methods to rule out the possibility of ex vivo neutralization by serum antibody during tissue preparation. Such ex vivo neutralization has been shown to account for a reduction of up to 300-fold in detectable virus in the lungs of mice that had undergone passive transfer of immune serum against SARS-CoV [30] . The use of nasal and bronchiolar wash samples, instead of tissue homogenates, for viral quantitation was also employed as a solution to this issue [28']","The signs of illness in animals with H3N2 human influenza virus include fever, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and weight loss.","The signs of illness in animals infected with H3N2 human influenza virus can include loss of body weight, ruffled fur, lethargy, and respiratory problems. In some cases, animals may also exhibit signs such as necrosis and inflammation throughout the respiratory tract, including the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. These signs can vary depending on the specific strain of the virus and the animal species being studied.","What are the signs of illness in animals with H3N2 human influenza virus? ->: The signs of illness in animals infected with H3N2 human influenza virus can include loss of body weight, ruffled fur, lethargy, and respiratory problems.

134,What factors contribute to reduced breastfeeding rates?,"["" forgotten, and efforts need to include reaffirming the benefits of breastfeeding among our health care workers. Evidence suggests that health care workers' infant feeding advice is undermined by implementing national guidelines within local contexts and fears of HIV transmission [36] . Aside from the nutritional superiority, the safety and immune benefits of breastmilk may need to be asserted to counter concerns during the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Support for breastfeeding cannot be distanced from support for the mother. Social protection policies such as the child support grant top-up and the COVID-19 social relief of distress grant in South Africa can assist women to reduce hunger while breastfeeding. In addition, mothers need reassurance about the quality of their breastmilk and their ability to breastfeed. Health care professionals and community health workers are trusted experts in this context and should be empowered to support breastfeeding mothers.This study sought to investigate whether recently improved breastfeeding rates [3] were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown-associated changes in economic and social circumstances and to assess the association between breastfeeding, maternal depressive symptoms, maternal hunger, and clinic visits. No association was found between breastfeeding practice and maternal depressive symptoms in this study. The results show that hunger and not attending the clinic were associated with reduced breast-feeding. This confirms the importance of adequate nutrition, access to health care, and other structural barriers to breastfeeding uptake."", "" not allow conclusions beyond associations between breastfeeding and hunger within the COVID-19 context. Previous studies have identified a link between food insecurity or hunger and breastfeeding. A Canadian study observed that more than half of food-insecure mothers had ceased to breastfeed exclusively by 2 months [7] . A longitudinal cohort study in Kenya [25] found that maternal hunger was associated with lower rates of breastfeeding, but that mothers with greater self-efficacy across all levels of hunger were more likely to exclusively breastfeed than those with poor self-efficacy. Hunger in mothers may contribute to a perception of milk insufficiency and undermine confidence in their breastfeeding ability. A study in Kenya [26] found that there were greater odds that a woman in a food-insecure household would consider her breast milk insufficient and that they would not breastfeed for 6 months. For every one-point increase in the household food insecurity score, another Kenyan study [27] found that there was a decrease in breastmilk intake by the infant. A 2015 Canadian study postulated that household food insecurity could be a predictor of breastfeeding initiation due to concerns on the cost of alternate feeding, but concerns over their own food and nutrient intake and the quality or quantity of breastmilk they produced may lead some mothers to introduce formula milk [28] . Reducing hunger in mothers by improving household food security and improving breastfeeding self-efficacy in mothers could lead to higher rates of exclusive breastfeeding [25, 29] .COVID-19 is likely to increase stress levels in women. The stress that mothers from low-income households in South Africa experience could include concerns about their breastmilk supply, their access to food, having regular meals, and relationship difficulties in the home [29] . Women, in particular, face an increased care burden due to COVID-19, and this further increases the stress on them [30] .A key limitation of the findings presented here is the cross-sectional nature of this survey. Hunger and depressive symptoms have various dimensions that may change with time. The questions and tools used to assess these measures may also affect the results. The survey did not assess exclusive breastfeeding, as water and consumption of other substances commonly given to infants were not assessed. The findings of this survey cannot be generalised to the South African population, as only mothers who subscribed to the MomConnect platform and who chose to participate constituted the study sample. Mothers who accessed private health care services were thus excluded from this study. Although there was no significant difference in the response rates of the women based on the socioeconomic quintile of the primary care facility where they registered for MomConnect, there may have been systematic bias in the response based on information not available in the dataset. Due to the reliance on SMS communication, the survey could not gather information on a large range of determinants of breastfeeding.Based on the findings of this survey that mothers experiencing hunger are less likely to breastfeed, the authors recommend a paradigm shift in efforts to improve breastfeeding, to be more comprehensive. This includes strengthening of enabling capabilities [31] such as health-seeking behaviour and self-efficacy; direct nutrition support of pregnant and breastfeeding women; inclusion of the value of breastfeeding beyond only an immediate superior nutritional and hygienic feeding method to include the food security and aspects related to noncommunicable disease prevention; the inclusion of a whole-of-society approach [32] .Breastfeeding needs to be protected, promoted, and supported more than ever, as this can impact the health of future generations and also offers all infants a fairer/more equal start in life. In addition, mothers need to be encouraged to continue to attend the health clinic. Maternal and child nutrition needs to be prioritised alongside the COVID-19 response, or we will see the devastating impact of malnutrition, such as stunted growth, diminished cognitive potential, and an increased burden of noncommunicable diseases in the coming generations [33] .Among the four lifesaving interventions to be prioritised during COVID-19, the UN recommends mass communication to caregivers and families to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding in children aged 0-23 months [34] . Further communication, supporting the breastfeeding mother to enable her to breastfeed and feel competent to do so is a critical gap that needs to be addressed. Lee (2016) [35] argues that the ethical obligation to breastfeed a child extends beyond the mother to the broader society which has to provide social and economic support to enable breastfeeding, and this may also extend to providing food to the hungry breastfeeding mother as a priority (or enabling her to access nutritious food). Mothers also need reassurance on the quality of their breastmilk and their ability to breastfeed. From a health perspective, the benefits of breastmilk are undisputed and contrary to hungry mothers who cease breastfeeding in the belief that this will have a better outcome for their infants.The effect that COVID-19 has had on breastfeeding advice and support in South Africa is not known. South Africa's history and learnings from HIV and infant feeding guidance should not be""]",Hunger and not attending the clinic were associated with reduced breastfeeding.,"Several factors contribute to reduced breastfeeding rates, including:

221,What are the signs and changes in cats infected with H5N1 influenza?,"['ibody responses elicited by an infection in ferrets generally correlated with those seen in mice, but, as in the mouse model, the antibody responses did not correlate with virus replication. In the ferret model, live attenuated, cold-adapted H6 AI candidate vaccine viruses were attenuated compared to the corresponding wild-type H6 virus. None of the vaccine viruses caused signs of illness in ferrets, nor did they replicate in the lungs. A single intranasal dose of the vaccine viruses elicited serum neutralizing and HAI antibodies in ferrets, and, as in mice, conferred complete protection in the lower respiratory tract following wildtype virus challenge. The levels of neutralizing antibody induced in ferrets by these vaccine viruses did not accurately predict the outcome of challenge with heterologous H6 viruses. The H6 AI viruses generally behaved in a similar fashion in ferrets and in mice, but species-specific differences in the cross-reactive antibody responses were observed.The reconstructed 1918 H1N1 influenza virus replicated to high titers in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following intranasal inoculation [156] . All inoculated ferrets exhibited severe signs of disease that included lethargy, anorexia, sneezing, rhinorrhea, severe weight loss and high fever from day 2 p.i., and two out of three animals succumbed to infection by day 11. Unlike the highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in ferrets, viral replication was not detected in tissues outside the respiratory tract. Necrotizing bronchiolitis, moderate to severe alveolitis and edema were observed in the lungs of infected ferrets on day 3 p.i. The presence of viral antigen in the upper and lower portions of the bronchi, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium and in the hyperplasic epithelium within the alveoli was observed.There are few reports in the literature on influenza infection in cats. In studies conducted by Paniker and Nair in the 1970s [157, 158] , intranasal infection of anesthetized cats with influenza A/Hong/Kong/1968 (H3N2) virus freshly isolated from human cases or laboratory-and egg-adapted isolates did not result in clinical signs of influenza but virus was recovered from pharyngeal secretions, and infection induced HAI antibodies and was transmitted to contact animals. Infected cats did not display clinical signs of influenza. Hinshaw and colleagues [155] later demonstrated that intranasally administered H7N7 and H7N3 AI viruses replicated in the upper respiratory tract of cats without clinical signs of disease, and the cats developed HAI antibodies after infection.There was little interest in influenza infection and immunity in cats until the recent re-emergence of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses in Asia, when it was reported that a number of big cats, namely tigers and leopards in the zoos in Thailand, became infected with HPAI H5N1 viruses, apparently after they were fed infected chicken carcasses [9] . Infection in many of these felids was fatal, and later, anecdotal reports of H5N1 infection in domestic cats in areas where there were outbreaks of H5N1 infection in avian populations contributed to a surge in interest in H5N1 influenza in cats. The pattern of attachment of a human H5N1 influenza virus to respiratory tract tissues of a cat was similar to that seen with human tissue [152] .Experimental infection of European short haired cats with an H5N1 virus isolated from a human in Vietnam in 2004 resulted in clinical disease, virus replication in respiratory and extra-pulmonary tissues, and pathological changes consistent with H5N1 infections in humans [10, 159] . Clinical signs, including significant elevation in body temperature, decreased activity, conjunctivitis and labored breathing were seen in cats experimentally infected intratracheally or by feeding on infected chicks [10] . Similar disease symptoms were observed in sentinel cats that became infected from being housed with cats that had been infected intratracheally. Illness in contact cats became apparent about 3 days later than in the cats infected via the intratracheal route. Peak viral titers in the throat swabs of the intratracheally infected cats were~10 4.5 TCID 50 /ml, whereas the peak titers observed in nasal swabs ranged from 10 2.5 to 10 5.0 TCID 50 /ml [159] . The virus was also recovered from rectal swabs of cats infected by feeding on infected chicks, but the titers of virus in these samples varied widely. In addition, cats infected through feeding had lesions in the intestines.

Infected sentinel cats did not have detectable virus in tissues outside the respiratory tract; however, pathological changes were observed in the adrenal glands in one of the two sentinel cats infected in this manner. These studies demonstrated that HPAI H5N1 viruses are capable of extrapulmonary spread in cats, and can cause severe disease and even death in animals infected intratracheally or by feeding on infected bird carcasses. These observations also raise the possibility that the gastrointestinal tract may serve as a source for HPAI infection in cats.Karaca et al. [160] studied the immunogenicity of a fowlpox-based H5 vaccine in cats. HAI antibodies were detected in serum of cats following a single subcutaneous dose of the vaccine, and a significant boost in antibody titers was observed following a second vaccination.It remains to be seen if cats will be used extensively in the evaluation of vaccines against pandemic influenza.Saito and colleagues conducted a study to evaluate the replication and pathogenicity of influenza viruses of various subtypes in Syrian hamsters [161] . The influenza A/HK/1073/99 (H9N2) virus replicated to high titers in the lungs, but was not lethal to hamsters and was not detected in the brain. The HPAI H5N1 influenza A/HK/ 483/97 virus, that was highly virulent in mice, was also lethal in hamsters, with all animals succumbing to infection by day 6 p.i., and, as in mice, virus was recovered from the brain of the infected hamsters. Avian H9N2 and H9N5 isolates could replicate in the lungs of hamsters, but did so to lower titers compared to human isolates. The human H9N2 virus elicited low levels of neutralizing antibody in infected hamsters, whereas the avian H9N2 isolate did not elicit detectable neutralizing antibody. The behavior of this limited number of AI isolates in the Syrian hamster model suggests that the effects of this viruses may be similar to that observed in mice, and further evaluation of this model for evaluating the efficacy of pandemic influenza vaccines is warranted.There is renewed interest in the use of non-human primates for immunogenicity studies of pandemic vaccines; this is based on the presumption that immune responses in these animals, which have a closer evolutionary relationship to humans, may be more predictive of the responses in humans than in smaller animals like mice and ferrets. To date, few data are available on the serological responses of non-human primates to AI virus vaccines.The use of cynomolgus macaques as a model for influenza virus infection in humans was revisited following the emergence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 AI viruses in 1997 [162] . The initial human H5N1 influenza isolate, A/Hong Kong/ 156/1997, isolated from a fatal case of influenza in a child [6] , was inoculated at multiple sites, including the trachea, tonsils and conjunctiva. Three of four animals developed fever within 2 days, and one showed signs of anorexia and acute respiratory distress. High titers of virus were recovered from lungs on day 4 p.i., and the virus was also isolated from the trachea, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and the heart. The virus was not recovered from these tissues on day 7 p.i. The virus was also recovered from bronchioalveolar lavage from 2 out of 2 animals on days 3 and 5 p.i.; from pharyngeal swabs of two animals on day 5 p.i., and from nasal swabs of one animal on days 3 and 7. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in the brains of two animals on day 4 p.i., and in the spleen of all four animals tested on day 7 p.i. Pathological changes in the lungs of infected animals included pulmonary consolidation, necrotizing broncho-interstitial pneumonia and flooding of alveoli with edema fluid, fibrin, erythrocytes, cell debris, macrophages, and neutrophils, and inflammatory changes were seen in multiple organs [163] .Infection of Rhesus macaques with avian H5N1 isolates, reported by Chen et al. [164] , indicated that results of intranasal inoculation varied depending on the influenza virus isolate used. Clinical signs of infection, including elevation in body temperature, anorexia and increased respiratory rate were observed in macaques inoculated with the following H5N1 viruses: A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1/ 2005, A/great cormorant/Qinghai/3/2005 and A/duck/Guangxi/35/2001.

It was then analyzed foreseeing and drawing the final conclusion.Expected Impact pre COVID The following are the various impact of Digital India campaign on economy of India. Figure below discusses the Economic, Social, and Environmental Impact of Digital India.Initiatives Statistics Digital Identity (AADHAR) Source-digitalindia.gov.in (Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India) (Fig. 3) .The numbers show that considerable effort has already been put by the government of India but still a lot needs to be done. As per the impact on various sectors says that the execution needs to be better planned for effective implementation and visible impact on the economy.For many companies, technology is a key tool to cope with the new demands brought about by the COVID crisis. For other companies, it is also crucial to adjust their processes and continue operations [5] . Policy decisions in this area will directly affect how easy it is for companies to adapt to new realities, whether it is in supporting companies to move forward or removing obstacles to new business models. Technology-driven economies also provide various opportunities for economic decision makers so that they can be awareness regarding to obtain real-time situations.Business Continuity and Digitisation-Changing trends Nowadays, businesses modified their operations from old traditional to online or revamp themselves altogether to deliver timely and appropriate services during the tough times of COVID [6]:• The crisis due to corona viruses has toppled the powerful inertia of many traditional systems and prompted the acceptance of digital (online) services, which have found new tools and adapted them to their backgrounds. In the long run, this may make the economy better able to increase productivity, growth, and adaptable. • For businesses, the fulcrum of online exchange includes everything from restaurant-based delivery to fitness classes via video link. Not all content can be moved online, but the wide availability of tools that support the Internet age means that the businesses that manage them are far more likely to have them than they might have before. • Marketing and advertising need to be sustainable for the basic growth of businesses. In order to continue for long run, digital marketing is required. For helping the start-ups, Indian government is providing financial support for advertising. • Patreon, for example, is a paid membership platform for online creators, with an average user growth rate of about a third higher than in February, while the video conferencing platform Zoom grew from 10 million to 200 million. Behind the scenes, insurance start-ups are also adjusting their policies to achieve more on-demand and flexible services as the nature of their activities changes, while digital identity providers are stepping up efforts to facilitate remote on boarding, right-of-work checks, and electronic signatures. • Since the current transition is based on market-based accessible and affordable tools, government support should focus on raising awareness, convening, and sharing lessons learned. The most effective interventions may be based on amplification and convening (e.g., through online resources or digital networking plans) to accelerate the growth and impact of these steps. it is very difficult for the us to make them digital as they are still not able to fulfill their basic necessities. The digital technology is costly and needs to learn before reaping its benefits. 6. Ignorance of the people: This new initiatives require a lot of awareness, focusing on the various aspects of the plan. People are still unaware about the initiatives and the benefits they will be having from the policy. Because any change to be implemented must be bagged by the acceptability of the people at first place. 7. Unsecure: The digital technology must be updated to be more secure and should be friendlier to the people. The possibility fraud in this system cannot be underrated. 8. Infrastructural facilities required the mode of digital communications that are still lacking in India. This requires a lot more investment after doing the cost benefit analysis to make it more viable for the people. We require a high speed network, greater connectivity, many more towers to be installed, easy availability of devices supporting digital technology. 9. Not easily accepted by the traditional society: Any new technology is not accepted easily by the traditional society. As they still very strongly believe that there older modes of communication are good and easy for them.']",The challenges and problems faced due to COVID-19 for technology-enabled development in India include: 1.

107,Which virus was isolated from infected animals in the study involving the duck isolate and what were the symptoms in the control animals?,"[' pronounced in the monkeys inoculated with the duck isolate. However, the only virus to be re-isolated from infected animals was A/duck/Guangxi/35/2001, and this virus was isolated from respiratory tract secretions and tissues and also from the spleen, liver and the heart. The Rhesus macaque model has been used to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of a candidate live attenuated cold-adapted H5N1 vaccine [113] . The vaccine virus derives its HA and NA from the clade 2.3 A/Anhui/2/2005 (H5N1) virus and the six internal protein genes from the cold-adapted A/AA/6/60 ca virus. The multibasic cleavage site in the HA gene was removed. Animals were inoculated intranasally with 10 7 EID 50 of the vaccine virus on days 0 and 28. Serum antibodies in the vaccinated macaques were detected by ELISA 2 weeks following the first dose, with an apparent boost after the second dose. Four weeks after the first dose of vaccine all animals had detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies in the serum. After the second dose of vaccine, HAI and neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of all the vaccinated animals. HAI and neutralizing titers against a heterologous H5N1 virus were two to fourfold lower than against the homologous virus. T cell responses, measured by IFN-g ELISPOT, were detected following the second dose of the vaccine. Three weeks after the second vaccination, the macaques were challenged intratracheally with 10 6 EID 50 of either the parent A/Anhui/2/2005 (H5N1) virus, or the A/bar headed goose/Qinghai/1/2005 (H5N1) virus. Control animals had symptoms of illness including anorexia, fever and loss of appetite from day 1 post-challenge. Four control animals were euthanized on day 3 post-challenge and the remaining 4 animals gradually recovered. None of the vaccinated animals exhibited any clinical signs of illness. Pathological changes in the lungs of the unvaccinated control animals were more severe than in the vaccinated animals, and viral antigen was only detected in cells of the control animals. Virus was not isolated from any organs of vaccinated animals, whereas high titers of virus were detected in the respiratory tissues of the control animals. Rudenko et al. described the evaluation of the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live attenuated cold-adapted vaccine virus, which is based on the low pathogenicity A/duck/Potsdam/86 (H5N2) virus, as a candidate vaccine against H5N1 in Java macaques [165] . This vaccine candidate is a 7:1 reassortant, and derives its HA from A/duck/Potsdam/86 (H5N2) and its NA and internal protein genes from the donor virus for the live attenuated influenza vaccines used in Russia, A/Leningrad/17/57 (H2N2). Monkeys vaccinated with two doses of the H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine virus, 21 days apart, did not exhibit signs of illness, and virus was recovered from 2 out of 4 animals, at titers between 10 1.2 and 10 4.2 EID 50 /ml between days 3 and 5 after the first dose. The dose of vaccine virus used was not reported. The H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine virus elicited only modest HAI responses in the vaccinated macaques. The animals were challenged with the HPAI A/chicken/Kurgan/02/2005 (H5N1) isolate. Vaccinated animals developed a fever, but it was of a lower grade and of a shorter duration than that observed in the control animals, and shedding of challenge virus occurred in vaccinated animals, but it was for a shorter duration than in the control animals. These data suggest that there may be a small protective effect of the H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine virus against heterologous H5 virus challenge, however, the numbers of animals used was small and the immune responses that were observed were not consistent between animals. The H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in small numbers of volunteers [166] . The vaccine was evaluated at two different dose levels, and two doses were found to be safe and immunogenic in 47-55% of subjects. HAI antibodies were detected in the serum of the vaccine recipients and IgA antibodies were detected by ELISA in nasal wash samples. Qualitatively, these responses were similar to those observed in the mouse model. The level of replication of the vaccine virus in humans was not reported.Cynomolgus macaques were evaluated as a model for studying the reconstructed 1918 H']","A/duck/Guangxi/35/2001 was isolated from infected animals in the study involving the duck isolate.

50,How can the active/passive and synchronous/asynchronous dimensions be used to characterize nudging interventions for healthcare providers?,"[' of interventions: those targeting vaccination orders for patients and those targeting staff vaccination. While all the patient-focused interventions had a positive result, two out of three interventions directed at HCPs did not. It is noteworthy that these passive and asynchronous strategies could easily be ignored, whereas the patient-oriented strategies were active and synchronous, requiring immediate action, which could prove valuable during a mass vaccination campaign. That said, HCPs might now have a much different emotional and cognitive response to COVID-19 than influenza, and new intervention strategies should be investigated. The significant positive results found by Lorini et al 31 could for instance be due to the already large impact of COVID-19 affecting inclination towards vaccination among HCPs. Other studies have shown vaccine hesitancy among skilled nursing facility staff regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, either because of the development and testing or personal fears of getting sick. 63 An effective behaviour change strategy for COVID-19 vaccines uptake will therefore need to address multiple beliefs and behavioural determinants, by reducing barriers and leveraging enablers. 64 Text-based reminders have for instance been shown to be effective to get patients vaccinated, especially when designed to make them feel ownership of the vaccine dose, 65 66 and that the vaccine dose was reserved for them. 65 This has also been tested on actual uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. 66 This is something future nudging studies need to explore when it comes to HCPs.Nudging antibiotic prescriptions Appropriate hospital antibiotic use is a key element in patient safety, and it has been shown that antibiotics are often unnecessary in the treatment of COVID-19. 67 Although bacterial co-pathogens are common in viral respiratory infections, the prevalence of bacterial infections in patients with COVID-19 is not well understood. 68 Hence, the prevention of inappropriate antibiotic use is important not only to reduce the risk of opportunistic infections and other adverse drug events, but also to deter the natural selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 69 70 Our review indicates that social interventions such as public pledges, public-facing commitment letters and peer comparisons can effectively reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. EHRs or electronic prescription systems are important tools for changing prescribing behaviour. Both passive and active strategies have shown promise for reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. Health providers should not only consider how medications are displayed, but also the steps required to complete an order as possible windows of opportunities to deliver nudging interventions via the EHR.Using the two-dimensional view of nudging The active/passive and synchronous/asynchronous dimensions are practical in characterising how and when HCPs are exposed to the nudging intervention, without requiring deep knowledge of behavioural economics or behavioural psychology.These two dimensions created four quadrants, each containing different nudging strategies (figure 3). While active strategies enable the clinician to consciously reflect on the target behaviour, passive strategies can reduce their cognitive burden by making a behaviour easier or automatic.Evidence suggests that different nudging techniques can be used in clinical settings as simple, cost-effective strategies to fight COVID-19, reduce complications for intubated patients, improve hand hygiene, increase vaccination rates and avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. These strategies could be important in the continued handling of the pandemic, which will not be over until the whole world reaches herd immunity from vaccination. Figure 3 Examples of how nudging strategies fit into a two-dimensional view of nudging. EHR, electronic health record.As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there is a need to gather the best available evidence-based treatment to avoid death and unnecessary suffering. The first wave led to better treatment options during the second and third wave. 71 Nudging techniques can be an easy and costeffective way to optimise care and, ultimately, save lives.Twitter Andreas Vilhelmsson @andvilhelm']",The active/passive and synchronous/asynchronous dimensions can be used to characterize nudging interventions for healthcare providers by determining how and when they are exposed to the intervention.,"The active/passive and synchronous/asynchronous dimensions can be used to characterize nudging interventions for healthcare providers based on how and when healthcare providers are exposed to the nudging intervention. The active strategies require conscious reflection on the target behavior, while passive strategies reduce cognitive burden by making a behavior easier or automatic. Synchronous strategies coincide with the decision or behavior they intend to affect, while asynchronous strategies can be performed at any time. By categorizing nudging interventions along these dimensions, it becomes easier to understand how different strategies can influence healthcare providers' behavior in clinical settings.","How can the active/passive and synchronous/asynchronous dimensions be used to characterize nudging interventions for healthcare providers? ->: The active/passive and synchronous/asynchronous dimensions can be used to characterize nudging interventions for healthcare providers based on how and when healthcare providers are exposed to the nudging intervention.

224,What are the two methods used by chimpanzees for parasite expulsion and what problems do they address?,"[' (Dubost et al. 2019; Greene et al. 2020) .Possibly the most numerous studies have been conducted on non-human primates. This is particularly relevant for human evolution since humans and non-human primates share a common evolutionary history and have a similar physiology and it is possible that they share ways to combat diseases through medicinal plant use (Huffman 2016) . This includes studies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) (Basabose 2002; Cousins and Huffman 2002; Rogers et al. 2004; Huffman 2001 Huffman , 2003 Huffman , 2015 Huffman and Seifu 1989; Huffman et al. 1996; Mclennan and Huffman 2012; Krief et al. 2006; Masi et al. 2012) , Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) (Huffman et al. 2010; Tasdemir et al. 2020) , sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) (Carrai et al. 2003) , lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) (Peckre et al. 2018) , Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) , and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) (Morrogh-Bernard et al. 2017) . Some of these studies have demonstrated both health maintenance and deliberate self-medication that is processed using a combination of innate mechanisms, individual learning, and cultural transmission (Huffman 2016) . In all recorded cases, the plants used have been subjected to pharmacological analyses that have identified specific properties that correspond with the use of the plant. In addition to the use of plants in treatment, there are many examples of the use of foodmedicines, or medicinal foods, plants that are eaten as food, but that also contain important medicinal properties and therefore provide an underlying protection, with specific food items added in particular, in relation to parasite infection and reproductive events, though Huffman et al. (2020) have identified the use of Epimedium davidii Franch, Berberidaceae, potentially as a means of stress reduction in a preliminary study on Tibetan macaques. Icariin (10), a major prenylated flavonol glycoside, is the active principle associated with stress reduction and anti-depressant properties via downregulation of glucocorticoid receptor activity and regulation of hippocampal neuroinflammation (Li et al. 2015) .Chimpanzees display botanical knowledge when selecting plants (Janmaat et al. 2013 ) and also know the plant\'s location, when and how much to eat, the correct part of the plant and, at times, how to prepare it prior to ingestion (Huffman 2003; Cousins and Huffman 2002; Huffman and Seifu 1989; Huffman et al. 1996) . Of the 200-300 species of plant that they habitually use in their diet, at least 36 are medicinal (Huffman 2001) while some of the best studied self-medication practices in animals are in the way chimpanzees deal with intestinal parasites. Exhaustive study has demonstrated the use of two different methods, using plants that are not necessarily an everyday part of the diet (Huffman 2016; Huffman and Seifu 1989; Huffman et al. 1996 Huffman et al. , 2016 . Bitter pith chewing treats intestinal nematode infections and gastrointestinal problems while leaf swallowing addresses the problem of adult nodular worms and tapeworms (Huffman 2016) . In bitter pith chewing, the outer bark and leaves of the plant Vernonia amygdalina Delile, Asteraceae, are removed, the bitter juice contained in the inner pith is then chewed, and the remaining fibrous material is spat out. This member of the daisy family is not abundant and is searched out for consumption only when a chimpanzee is ill. Following the bitter pith chewing, chimpanzees invariably improve (Huffman and Seifu 1989; Huffman et al. 1996 Huffman et al. , 2016 . The biochemical properties of V. amygdalina consist of a range of medicinally useful chemicals while laboratory testing demonstrated the efficacy of the plant, which is also well known and used by local human populations for its medicinal properties as a treatment for intestinal parasites, stomach upsets and malaria (Huffman 2016) . Leaf swallowing involves the physical expulsion of worms through increased gut action (motility) which is caused by the selection and swallowing of whole, rough leaves (Huffman et al. 1996) . Leaves from over 40 different plant species are used; the main common property of the leaves is that they have silicate hairs that ""catch"" the worms. The leaves are eaten in a particular way, they are folded in the mouth and swallowed without chewing, normally on an empty stomach. This inhibits digestion and the leaves are normally flushed out, with attached parasites,']","The two methods used by chimpanzees for parasite expulsion are bitter pith chewing and leaf swallowing. Bitter pith chewing treats intestinal nematode infections and gastrointestinal problems, while leaf swallowing addresses the problem of adult nodular worms and tapeworms.","The two methods used by chimpanzees for parasite expulsion are bitter pith chewing and leaf swallowing.

174,What are the genotypes of the bovine Norovirus sequences in Argentinean dairy calves and what is the potential new genotype GIII.4?,"['en and hindgut of cattle and sheep (Nathan et al., 2015) .Positive samples for bovine Norovirus were identified as Bo/AR/ 2012/B4836 (B4836), Bo/AR/2012/B4848 (B4848) and Bo/AR/2012/ B4881 (B4881). These three samples came from young calves with diarrhea from different provinces of Argentina. Sample B4836 was collected from a 9-day-old calf from a dairy herd in Santa Fe province. Sample B4848 came from a 2-day-old calf from Buenos Aires province and B4881 was taken from a 3-day-old animal from Córdoba province. All Norovirus positive samples were collected in 2012. Using the BLAST tool, the three partial sequences obtained from RdRp gene showed to be genetically most closely related to GIII bovine Norovirus sequences. The sequence of B4848 was most closely related with GIII.1 viruses, whereas both B4836 and B4881 were most closely related to GIII.2 viruses (Fig. 1A) . Considering the fact that recombination commonly occurs at the ORF1-ORF2 junction, we attempted to get the complete VP1 coding sequences by next generation sequencing, which was successful for the B4848 and B4881 strains. By phylogenetic analyses, these two sequences were more closely related to GIII.1 viruses (Fig. 1B) . This indicates contradictory phylogenetic inferences for B4881, grouping the polymerase (ORF1, RdRp) and capsid regions (ORF2, VP1) of this strain into different genotypes, which may suggest recombination between the RdRp and VP1 coding regions at the genotype level.In order to clarify if strain B4881 could be a recombinant genotype, a nucleotide identity plot -Simplotanalysis was performed on the sequence encompassing the end of the RdRp gene (ORF1, 3′ region, 498 nt), and both the entire ORF2 and ORF3 regions. For this analysis both reference strains for genotypes GIII.1 (GIII.1 Jena) and GIII.2 (GIII.2 Newbury2) were included. For ORF1, the percentage of nucleotide identity between B4881 and GIII.1 Jena was between 83% and 91%, while the similarity to GIII.2 Newbury2 was between 63% and 82% (Fig. 2) . However, Fig. 2 shows a putative recombination breakpoint located within the ORF1/ORF2 overlap, from where B4881 nucleotide sequence seems to be more similar to GIII.2 Newbury2 sequence than to GIII.1 Jena. Furthermore, for the ORF2/3 region, the similarity between B4881 and both GIII.1 Jena and GIII.2 Newbury2 strains is particularly low, especially in the more variable region of the capsid coding sequence (P domain). These results suggest that B4881 sequence could be a representative of a potential new genotype within GIII, tentatively named GIII.4.To further explore the positions of the amino acid changes observed in B4848 and B4881, their VP1 sequences were compared to reference strain GIII.1 Jena, using three-dimensional modeling (Fig. 3) . Because VP1 is the major capsid protein, it is important to evaluate if the amino acid changes are mainly in the P domain or the S domain, especially because the P domain has both cell receptor ligand and immunogenic determinant activities. As expected, B4881 showed a higher number of modifications than B4848 compared to GIII.1 Jena reference sequence. It seems also clear that most of the amino acid changes observed in B4881 are located at the P domain. The circulation of bovine Noroviruses has been poorly studied in South America, with only a single report of a partial RdRp sequences from bovine enteric caliciviruses in Venezuela (Alcala et al., 2003) . In the present work, a screening was conducted aiming at the detection of Norovirus in Argentinean cattle herds belonging to the main dairy regions of the country. Both genotype GIII.1-and GIII.2-related sequences were found to circulate in Argentinean dairy calves. Moreover, according to the genetic analyses, one of the sequences (B4881) may also constitute a potential new genotype in the bovine Norovirus GIII, tentatively named GIII.4.The detection rate of Norovirus reported in this study (3.3%) is in agreement with studies in Belgium (7.5%, 10 out of 133 fecal samples using a CBECu-F/R primer set)']",The genotypes of the bovine Norovirus sequences in Argentinean dairy calves are GIII.1 and GIII.2.

225,"What is the role of the JAK-STAT pathway in autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions, and why are JAK1 and JAK3 targeted by pharmaceutical inhibitors?","[' (CALR) 68 69 that endow mutated CALR proteins the ability to bind and activate the same TpoR in the absence of ligand. [70] [71] [72] [73] Thus, for this very large group of diseases with increasing prevalence (0.4-0.7/1000, 5 times higher than chronic myeloid leukemia induced by the BCR-Abelson kinase (ABL) fusion protein) the cause is persistent activation of JAK2 in clonal HSCs, which gives a major advantage to progenitors of red blood cells, platelets and granulocytes, leading to clonal expansion of these lineages in the absence of cytokines.In the same time with the identification of JAK2 V617F it was shown that homologous mutations activate constitutively JAK1 (V658F) and TYK2 (V678F) 66 and these and other activating mutations were identified in T-acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL), in B-ALL and several other conditions. 74 75 Overall, these findings provided an impetus to search for potent inhibitors of JAKs.The second reason why JAKs became prime targets for the pharmaceutical industry is represented by excessive activation of cytokines and their receptors in autoimmune diseases. The prime targets were members of the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21 and especially the two JAK proteins associated with subunits of this group, namely JAK1 and JAK3. 76 Inhibitors were thus seeked that could inhibit JAK1 and JAK3, or only JAK3. Such inhibitors were discovered and it was found that only inhibiting JAK3 exerts a much weaker effect than inhibiting JAK1 and JAK3, implying that JAK1 is the dominant JAK, 77 and that JAK3 needs to be present in the complex, as a scaffold, but its catalytic activity is not as crucial as that of JAK1. 77 78 Indeed, absence of JAK3 has a blocking effect while inhibiting the kinase domain only exerts a minor effect. 77 79 More recently, increased interest in JAKi strategies arose for the need of new treatments for pathological inflammatory conditions like hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) where overactive T cells and macrophages secrete numerous proinflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18 and TNF-α, involving the JAK-STAT pathway. 80 Samewise in COVID-19, the JAK-STAT pathway is implicated in complement hyperactivation in SARS-CoV-2-infected respiratory epithelial cells 81 and in the activation of CD4 + and CD8 + positive T cells, NK cells and monocytes which cooperate with elevated levels of IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-17. Indeed, very high levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-α and G-CSF were described in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care. 82 Furthermore, JAK-STAT activation promotes senescence of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, which amplifies inflammation. 83 Therefore, JAKi, and especially JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, were suggested as a potential therapy against systemic inflammation in COVID-19 84 because treatment with a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor to prevent lung injury in severe COVID-19 would be able to reduce cytokine action more effectively than blocking one cytokine at a time (like IL-6. 85 The major strategy used for obtaining kinase inhibitors is to obtain compounds that prevent ATP entrance in the ATP binding pocket. ATP is obligatory as a source of phosphate for catalysis. The small molecule inhibitor may bind and compete with ATP, or may bind to close-by sites or distant sites that allosterically prevent ATP binding to the ATP pocket. The kinase inhibitors may bind to active kinases and inhibit them (type I) or may bind to the inactive kinase, and block the transition to active kinase (type II). 86 The very well-known kinase inhibitor imatinib inhibits the Abelson kinase (ABL), PDGF receptor and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases. Imatinib binds to kinases when they are inactive (type II), thus preventing activation. All current JAKi used in the clinics so far are type I inhibitors, and they only recognize and bind kinase domain of JAKs in their active conformation.

It will be interesting to learn whether genotype-specific antibodies recognize known binding sites but have a different amino acid configuration or whether the genotype 2.VII specific epitopes are formed by different sites. Overall our studies highlight the value of MAb to dissect antigenic sites. The established MAbs are the first step to define genotype 2.VII specific neutralizing sites of NDV based on sequence information and should enable phylogenic analysis of antigenic sites in the future, a prerequisite to elucidate whether antigenic drift was the driving factor for evolution of NDV. In addition, well defined MAbs serve as valuable diagnostic tools to specifically detect NDV antigen for example in lateral flow devices or can be used for serological tests. When, for example, applied in blocking ELISA systems genotype specific reagents would allow to differentiate infected from vaccinated individuals (DIVA) by specifically detecting genotype 2.I, 2.II or 2.VII specific antibodies. The presented work flow provides a powerful method to generate and characterize these reagents.']",Epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies can aid in understanding genotype-specific antibodies in NDV by helping to elucidate the specific epitopes recognized by genotype-specific antibodies.,"Epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) can aid in understanding genotype-specific antibodies in Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) by helping to identify specific neutralizing epitopes of different genotypes.

207,"How does the learning rate affect the training performance of the proposed summarization model, based on the context?","[' are trained from scratch, the learning rate for the untrained parameters should be relatively higher to quickly reach a reasonable distribution. Following [57] , we adopt the NORM learning rate scheduling strategy to enable the value of learning rate to linearly increase for specific steps and exponentially decrease. We obtained the optimal hyper-parameters for comparison methods by tuning them on the CORD-19 validation set. The parameters of all comparison methods were tuned on validation split of the CORD-19 summarization dataset, as was COVIDSum.After tuning the hyper-parameters by evaluating variations of our proposed method on the validation dataset, we obtained a group of best hyper-parameters for COVIDSum, as shown in Table 2 (type_bert and type_fuse are types of models used in our proposed architecture as sequence encoder and feature fusion module, respectively. type_sent_ext denotes the heuristic method of sentence extraction, num_gat represents the number of graph attention layers in the knowledge encoder. lr_pt indicates the learning rate for the pre-trained encoder and lr_ri refers to one for the randomly initialized modules in our proposed architecture. warmup_pt and warmup_ri are the numbers of warm-up steps for the pre-trained modules and untrained modules, respectively). In the following experiments for our proposed model, we only adjust corresponding modules in each subsection, while the others remain the tuned best settings in Table 2 .In the inference process, we obtain the predicted summaries by the beam search algorithm with a beam width of 5 and length penalty α = 0.6. We train and evaluate each of the models in our experiments with 20 K steps on two piece of GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU.The abstractive summarization module in our proposed model cannot handle the source texts without abridgment, because the original papers are almost 7000 words on average but the maximum sequence length for BERT is restricted to 512. Therefore, the heuristic sentence extraction methods are essential for our two-stage summarization model. In this set of experiments, we study the impact of different heuristic methods for sentence extraction. Statistics of the abstract-body pair datasets using our proposed sentence extraction methods are listed in Table 3 . We find that all three proposed heuristic extraction methods can effectively reduce the length of the source papers, so that our pretrained language model-based approach can handle the input sequences. Table 4 shows experimental results with three different heuristic extraction methods that have been explained in Section 3.2.The results in Table 4 show that the abstractive summarization performance using Heuristic1 is rather competitive, which indicates the Introduction section contains enough salient information to generate a summary of the corresponding paper. ROUGE-2 values drop 1.34 and 4.40 points when the sentence extraction method is replaced with Heuristic2 or Heuristic3. From this observation, we infer that the essential information is distributed throughout sections in a paper, but relatively more concentrated in the Introduction, followed by the Conclusion section.Thus, we can safely conclude that Heuristic1 is the best method to extract sentences. More specifically, we deem that most COVID-19 related scientific papers address the salient points in the Introduction sections, and the sentences at the beginning and the end of each section in a scientific paper are less informative for the composition of scientific abstracts.To further explore how the performance of our proposed models vary with different sequence encoders, we adopt original BERT, and its two domain-specific variations, i.e., SciBERT and BioBERT, as sequence encoder separately. In Table 5 , we present the detailed information of the three pre-trained models, including their corpora for pre-training, sizes of vocabulary, and hyper-parameters for their structures.We only change the type of sequence encoder and keep other settings in Table 2 in this experiment. The curves of training losses and perplexities are presented in Fig. 4 , and the results on the test set are provided in Table 5 .From Fig. 4 , we observe that cross-entropy loss of the three summarization models drop beneath 3.0 within 20,000 fine-tuning steps and continue to decline, the perplexity curves show the same trend. Perplexity is an evaluation metric for language models and reflects the uncertainty when a probabilistic model makes predictions. Among these curves, we find SciBERT-based model offers the worst training performance, and the BioBERT-based model surpasses the other two models in terms of convergence. Table 6 shows the results of three variations of our proposed summarization model on the test set, from which we can make the following observations: 1) SciBERT-based model performs well on the test set, although the converges of its training loss curve is the slowest among the three models, which indicates that the overfitting issue on the training set occurs when fine-tuning the pre-trained models; 2) when the BERTbased sequence encoder is replaced with domain']",The learning rate affects the training performance of the proposed summarization model by enabling the value of learning rate to linearly increase for specific steps and exponentially decrease.

The learning rate of the proposed summarization model has a significant impact on the training performance, as it controls the step size of the optimization process. A higher learning rate can lead to faster convergence but may also result in overshooting the optimal solution, leading to suboptimal performance. On the other hand, a lower learning rate may result in slower convergence but can help avoid overshooting and ensure a more stable optimization process.

Two molecules are mainly under focus of this review, baricitinib and ruxolitinib. Baricitinib exhibits an IC50 under 10 nM JAK1 and JAK2 (4.0-5.9 nM for JAK1 and 6.6-8.8 nM for JAK2), 787 nM for JAK3 and 61 nM TYK2, all determined at 1 mM ATP. 87 These values are different as a function of the amount of ATP used and may also depend on the technique to assay inhibition of kinase activity. [87] [88] [89] Ruxolitinib exhibits also IC50s of less than 10 nM for JAK1 and JAK2, specifically IC50 3.3-6.4 nM for JAK1, 2.8-8.8 nM for JAK2, 428-487 nM for JAK3 and approximately 10-fold selectivity for TYK2 (IC50 19-30 nM). [87] [88] [89] They are both type I inhibitors with rather low halflife, 4 hours for ruxolitinib and 12.5 hours for baricitinib. In addition, we will discuss tofacitinib (JAK1 and JAK3 inhibitor), upadacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor) and nezulcitinib (pan JAKi, inhaled). We will not discuss the strictly JAK1 specific filgotinib, as its clinical development is most recent. Also, a JAK2 inhibitor, fedratinib which was only recently approved in the clinics after a pause in development, will not be discussed. However, it appears that although all their differences a JAKi class effect is emerging, with potential relevance in COVID-19.Structural bases for inhibitor action. The first crystal structure of ruxolitinib was solved in complex with the kinase domain of c-Src, 90 while the structure of the JAK2 Open access kinase domain was solved in complex with a pan JAKi. 91 The X-ray crystal structure of baricitinib was initially solved in complex with a member of the Numb-associated kinases, namely BMP2-inducible kinase. 92 Only in 2021, in a very recent study which is being published in Blood the structures of ruxolitinib and of baricitinib were reported with the JAK2 kinase domain. 93 Of great interest, these structures allowed the first examination of ruxolitinib and baricitinib engaged with their main target (figure 2B). It also afforded design of ruxolitinib and baricitinib modified molecules where a linker was introduced to a solvent exposed carbon (C2 of the pyrimidine ring) of each inhibitor to which pomalidomide or thalidomide were linked. Proteolysis-targeting compounds were created and showed that they hold the potential to degrade JAK2 in target cells. 93 JAKi has known a broadening use in the clinics over the past decade and new molecules keep being designed. 94 Ruxolitinib, one of the oldest JAKi, is the agent most used in hematology patients whereas other JAKi such as baricitinib and tofacitinib are used more commonly in systemic rheumatic diseases (tofacitinib for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ulcerative colitis and baricitinib for patients with rheumatoid arthritis).There is extensive literature on the effects of JAKi in MPNs (in MF and complicated PV). In these conditions, the treatment is effective for alleviating symptoms, improving quality of life, overall survival, decreasing spleen size, but is not curative, as allele burdens do not significantly decrease. Most importantly, resistance to treatment exists, that is not linked to further mutations in the driver JAK2 gene. This is very different from the situation with imatinib and BCR/ABL1 driven chronic myeloid leukemia where mutations in ABL kinase domain, the main target, are explaining resistance. 95 These results have been interpreted to suggest that the targets of JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib are non-mutated JAK1 and JAK2 in inflammatory cells, suggesting that JAKi may act as effective anti-inflammatory agents in MPNs, 96 which is indeed the goal of their use in systemic rheumatic diseases or in newer indications such as or HLH 80 or graft-versushost disease (GVHd).

219,What's the reason for the renewed interest in using non-human primates for pandemic vaccine studies?,"[', kidney and heart. Infected sentinel cats did not have detectable virus in tissues outside the respiratory tract; however, pathological changes were observed in the adrenal glands in one of the two sentinel cats infected in this manner. These studies demonstrated that HPAI H5N1 viruses are capable of extrapulmonary spread in cats, and can cause severe disease and even death in animals infected intratracheally or by feeding on infected bird carcasses. These observations also raise the possibility that the gastrointestinal tract may serve as a source for HPAI infection in cats.Karaca et al. [160] studied the immunogenicity of a fowlpox-based H5 vaccine in cats. HAI antibodies were detected in serum of cats following a single subcutaneous dose of the vaccine, and a significant boost in antibody titers was observed following a second vaccination.It remains to be seen if cats will be used extensively in the evaluation of vaccines against pandemic influenza.Saito and colleagues conducted a study to evaluate the replication and pathogenicity of influenza viruses of various subtypes in Syrian hamsters [161] . The influenza A/HK/1073/99 (H9N2) virus replicated to high titers in the lungs, but was not lethal to hamsters and was not detected in the brain. The HPAI H5N1 influenza A/HK/ 483/97 virus, that was highly virulent in mice, was also lethal in hamsters, with all animals succumbing to infection by day 6 p.i., and, as in mice, virus was recovered from the brain of the infected hamsters. Avian H9N2 and H9N5 isolates could replicate in the lungs of hamsters, but did so to lower titers compared to human isolates. The human H9N2 virus elicited low levels of neutralizing antibody in infected hamsters, whereas the avian H9N2 isolate did not elicit detectable neutralizing antibody. The behavior of this limited number of AI isolates in the Syrian hamster model suggests that the effects of this viruses may be similar to that observed in mice, and further evaluation of this model for evaluating the efficacy of pandemic influenza vaccines is warranted.There is renewed interest in the use of non-human primates for immunogenicity studies of pandemic vaccines; this is based on the presumption that immune responses in these animals, which have a closer evolutionary relationship to humans, may be more predictive of the responses in humans than in smaller animals like mice and ferrets. To date, few data are available on the serological responses of non-human primates to AI virus vaccines.The use of cynomolgus macaques as a model for influenza virus infection in humans was revisited following the emergence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 AI viruses in 1997 [162] . The initial human H5N1 influenza isolate, A/Hong Kong/ 156/1997, isolated from a fatal case of influenza in a child [6] , was inoculated at multiple sites, including the trachea, tonsils and conjunctiva. Three of four animals developed fever within 2 days, and one showed signs of anorexia and acute respiratory distress. High titers of virus were recovered from lungs on day 4 p.i., and the virus was also isolated from the trachea, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and the heart. The virus was not recovered from these tissues on day 7 p.i. The virus was also recovered from bronchioalveolar lavage from 2 out of 2 animals on days 3 and 5 p.i.; from pharyngeal swabs of two animals on day 5 p.i., and from nasal swabs of one animal on days 3 and 7. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in the brains of two animals on day 4 p.i., and in the spleen of all four animals tested on day 7 p.i. Pathological changes in the lungs of infected animals included pulmonary consolidation, necrotizing broncho-interstitial pneumonia and flooding of alveoli with edema fluid, fibrin, erythrocytes, cell debris, macrophages, and neutrophils, and inflammatory changes were seen in multiple organs [163] .Infection of Rhesus macaques with avian H5N1 isolates, reported by Chen et al. [164] , indicated that results of intranasal inoculation varied depending on the influenza virus isolate used. Clinical signs of infection, including elevation in body temperature, anorexia and increased respiratory rate were observed in macaques inoculated with the following H5N1 viruses: A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1/ 2005, A/great cormorant/Qinghai/3/2005 and A/duck/Guangxi/35/2001.

JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib act as effective anti-inflammatory agents in MPNs.,"Blocking JAK2 can lead to toxic effects on blood cell formation, causing anemia and thrombocytopenia. Additionally, JAK2 inhibitors may also have adverse effects on the immune response, potentially leading to reactivation of latent infections like herpes simplex, zona-zoster, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis. Furthermore, some patients treated with JAK2 inhibitors for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) developed aggressive B cell lymphomas. 

In MPNs, JAK2 inhibitors, like ruxolitinib, are believed to be effective in alleviating symptoms by acting as anti-inflammatory agents. They target non-mutated JAK1 and JAK2 in inflammatory cells, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressing the proliferation of effector T cells. This action impairs the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into IFNγ-and IL17A-producing cells, which helps in managing the inflammatory response associated with MPNs.","What are the toxic effects of blocking JAK2 for blood cell formation and how do JAK2 inhibitors affect inflammatory cells in MPNs? ->: Blocking JAK2 can lead to toxic effects on blood cell formation, causing anemia and thrombocytopenia. Additionally, JAK2 inhibitors may also have adverse effects on the immune response, potentially leading to reactivation of latent infections like herpes simplex, zona-zoster, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis. Furthermore, some patients treated with JAK2 inhibitors for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) developed aggressive B cell lymphomas.

58,What is the focus of the research on the Organism SARS-CoV-2?,"[' collected from the IEDB webserver by selecting Organism SARS-CoV-2 (ID:2697049, SARS2), and restricting to B and T cells assay. For each protein of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, a list of experimentally validated epitopes is provided. Following the definition of https://help.iedb.org/hc/en-us/articles/114094147751, it is possible to introduce a Response Frequency (RF) for each position i of the proteome. RF is defined as the number of positively responding subjects relative to the total number of those tested, averaged over all epitopes mapped to that position. Large values thus correspond to positions of high potential for immune escape.The IEDB website only reports the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the RF score -and not the RF score itself -to correct for the sample size. In our analysis we compute the mean RF score from the IEDB epitope data and use the 95% confidence upper and lower bounds provided by the IEDB to compute the confidence interval (CI = upperboundlowerbound) for each position.All ROC analyses were performed in R ((54), version 3.6.3) using the package pROC ((55), version 1. 16.2) . Controls and cases were defined by a variability cutoff parameter. Cutoffs for the variability, which define the subset of positions with low or high variability, were chosen to split into balanced subsets with the most similar number of observations possible in each subset, i.e. using the median. Positions with higher variability than the cutoff are considered positives.To ensure reproducibility and access to our results we provide at https://giancarlocroce.github.io/DCA_SARS-CoV-2/ the data generated in the course of this research and a jupyter-notebook to reproduce key figures and guide data analysis.

218,"What are the toxic effects of blocking JAK2 for red blood cell and platelet formation, and how do baricitinib and ruxolitinib affect JAK1 and JAK2 activity?","[' toxic effects due to blocking JAK2 for red blood cell and platelet formation will be less severe.The industry identified several small molecule ATP competitors with nM affinity to each of the JAKs, or to several JAKs. Two molecules are mainly under focus of this review, baricitinib and ruxolitinib. Baricitinib exhibits an IC50 under 10 nM JAK1 and JAK2 (4.0-5.9 nM for JAK1 and 6.6-8.8 nM for JAK2), 787 nM for JAK3 and 61 nM TYK2, all determined at 1 mM ATP. 87 These values are different as a function of the amount of ATP used and may also depend on the technique to assay inhibition of kinase activity. [87] [88] [89] Ruxolitinib exhibits also IC50s of less than 10 nM for JAK1 and JAK2, specifically IC50 3.3-6.4 nM for JAK1, 2.8-8.8 nM for JAK2, 428-487 nM for JAK3 and approximately 10-fold selectivity for TYK2 (IC50 19-30 nM). [87] [88] [89] They are both type I inhibitors with rather low halflife, 4 hours for ruxolitinib and 12.5 hours for baricitinib. In addition, we will discuss tofacitinib (JAK1 and JAK3 inhibitor), upadacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor) and nezulcitinib (pan JAKi, inhaled). We will not discuss the strictly JAK1 specific filgotinib, as its clinical development is most recent. Also, a JAK2 inhibitor, fedratinib which was only recently approved in the clinics after a pause in development, will not be discussed. However, it appears that although all their differences a JAKi class effect is emerging, with potential relevance in COVID-19.Structural bases for inhibitor action. The first crystal structure of ruxolitinib was solved in complex with the kinase domain of c-Src, 90 while the structure of the JAK2 Open access kinase domain was solved in complex with a pan JAKi. 91 The X-ray crystal structure of baricitinib was initially solved in complex with a member of the Numb-associated kinases, namely BMP2-inducible kinase. 92 Only in 2021, in a very recent study which is being published in Blood the structures of ruxolitinib and of baricitinib were reported with the JAK2 kinase domain. 93 Of great interest, these structures allowed the first examination of ruxolitinib and baricitinib engaged with their main target (figure 2B). It also afforded design of ruxolitinib and baricitinib modified molecules where a linker was introduced to a solvent exposed carbon (C2 of the pyrimidine ring) of each inhibitor to which pomalidomide or thalidomide were linked. Proteolysis-targeting compounds were created and showed that they hold the potential to degrade JAK2 in target cells. 93 JAKi has known a broadening use in the clinics over the past decade and new molecules keep being designed. 94 Ruxolitinib, one of the oldest JAKi, is the agent most used in hematology patients whereas other JAKi such as baricitinib and tofacitinib are used more commonly in systemic rheumatic diseases (tofacitinib for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ulcerative colitis and baricitinib for patients with rheumatoid arthritis).There is extensive literature on the effects of JAKi in MPNs (in MF and complicated PV). In these conditions, the treatment is effective for alleviating symptoms, improving quality of life, overall survival, decreasing spleen size, but is not curative, as allele burdens do not significantly decrease. Most importantly, resistance to treatment exists, that is not linked to further mutations in the driver JAK2 gene. This is very different from the situation with imatinib and BCR/ABL1 driven chronic myeloid leukemia where mutations in ABL kinase domain, the main target, are explaining resistance. 95 These results have been interpreted to suggest that the targets of JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib are non-mutated JAK1 and JAK2 in inflammatory cells, suggesting that JAKi may act as effective anti-inflammatory agents in MPNs, 96 which is indeed the goal of their use in systemic rheumatic diseases or in newer indications such as or HLH 80 or graft-versushost disease (GVHd).

48,What is the purpose of using the HN protein fraction in the immunization process?,"[' HN protein fraction in the antigen preparation used for immunization of mice, we were able to obtain six hybridoma cultures that are reactive by HI, i.e. are able to block the receptor binding site of the HN protein on erythrocytes, and four of them neutralized viral infectivity in LMH cell cultures. In addition, three further selected hybridoma cultures neither showed HI nor neutralizing activity. By western blot analyses, these latter MAbs revealed reactivity against viral proteins that migrate at 55 kD and, hence, do not target HN. In the past, antibodies against NDV have been prepared by using whole, mostly gradient-purified virus preparations [24, 26, 47] . With this approach Lana and colleagues reported that five hybridoma fusion experiments yielded 20 NDV specific MAbs, of which only three were reactive by HI. Earlier reports [35] obtained a single MAb from a total of 184 maintained hybridoma cultures that was specifically reactive with the homologous virus by HI. The described problems to obtain sufficient numbers of MAbs reactive with ND spike proteins might in part be explained by the composition of the viral particle, which is dominated by the highly immunogenic NP protein that fills the entire inner virion [48] . In addition, the M protein, forming an array underneath the viral membrane is abundant in the virion [49] . Both proteins account for ~ 30% of the virus-specific molecular masses in gradient-purified viral preparations when analyzed by nano-LC MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, and only about 10% of the virion are HN molecules [11; Karger personal communication]. By disrupting gradient-purified virus by Triton X-100 (2%) and 1 M KCl, Nishikawa and colleagues could increase the fraction of HI reactive HN-specific MAbs, retrieving 9 out of a total of 21 [50] . Our method also used Triton X-100 and KCl disruption, but we subsequently applied ultracentrifugation to enrich HN and deplete M and NP proteins. This procedure was able to pull down a high proportion of the proteins that migrate as a 55 kD band including the NP. The subsequent steps reduced the proportion of the 55 kD proteins further, but were not sufficient to remove all of the proteins: A slight band was still visible by Coomassie-staining (Fig. 1a) and reacted with the polyclonal antibody preparation from a ND vaccinated chicken (Fig. 1b) . This might be a result of incomplete separation of the interaction of the HN protein with the NP protein via the matrix protein [51] . Accordingly, three of the selected MAbs were reactive with the 55 kD band by western blot (Fig. 3) . However, the western blot with an F-specific (Fig. 1d) identified that a large proportion of the F1 protein was in the very first pellet of the antigen preparation, indicating that F protein was not part of the antigen. This would be in line with results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments, showing a direct interaction of F and NP and HN and M [51] . Thus, it is likely that the three HI-negative MAbs are directed against NP or P protein. Further studies on protein specificity will have to address this question and evaluate potential potency in diagnostic approaches. Harsher conditions for particle disruption might have yielded an improved depletion of nucleocapsid proteins but, at the same time, may have denatured HN and destroyed HI epitope conformation.Overall our aim to produce MAbs capable to block biologically active sites of the HN protein of genotype 2.VII NDV by using an HN-enriched fraction of purified virus proved to be successful. We obtained a sufficient number of HI-positive MAbs already with a single fusion experiment, and two thirds of the selected hybridoma cultures yielded HN-specific MAbs that were able to block receptor binding.Due to the complex structure of biologically relevant epitopes of the homo-tetrameric HN protein [52] [53] [54] , the approach to generate MAbs reactive with biologically activesites depends on native HN protein with the correct conformation, ideally from virus produced in eukaryotic cells ensuring bona fide glycosylation and folding. Reassuring evidence was obtained through the HI-positive antibody response of two mice immunized with enriched HN preparations. However, in order to select the appropriate antibodies, the screening system has to present the test antigen in its native conformation. When using the indirect ELISA techniques, immobilizing antigen directly to the plastic surfaces of the plates likely interferes with the conformational integrity of the antigen, and important epitopes may be unpredictably masked or exposed [55] . To avoid such structural alterations caused by the coating, Russel and colleagues used NDV infected and formalin fixed cells with']",The purpose of using the HN protein fraction in the immunization process is to obtain hybridoma cultures that are reactive by HI and can block the receptor binding site of the HN protein on erythrocytes.,"The purpose of using the HN protein fraction in the immunization process is to generate monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that can block biologically active sites of the HN protein of genotype 2.VII NDV.

88,"What were the observed pathologic changes in ferrets and non-human primates infected with influenza, and how do they compare?","[' Beyond a mild level of inactivity, overt clinical signs of influenza were not observed in ferrets inoculated with A/California/04/2009 [171, 172] . More pronounced clinical features, some resulting in euthanasia, were observed in ferrets inoculated with virus isolates from Texas and Mexico [172] , but not in animals that received pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus isolates from Wisconsin, the Netherlands and Japan [171] . The clinical symptoms seen in ferrets did not reflect the severity of infection in the patients from whom the viruses were isolated.In general, the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses and recent seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses replicated efficiently and to similar levels in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, but the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses achieved higher titers in the lungs [171, 172, 176] . The virus was also detected in rectal swabs and tissue samples taken from the intestinal tract of infected ferrets [172] . There have been sporadic reports of gastrointestinal symptoms in human cases of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza infection [177] , but this does not appear to be common, and the significance of this observation, with respect to pathogenesis of infection with these viruses, is not clear.Pathologic changes were observed in the respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated with either seasonal or pandemic H1N1 viruses, but the changes were more extensive and more severe in ferrets infected with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses. Itoh et al. reported similar levels of viral antigen in the nasal mucosa of animals that received either seasonal or pandemic virus. The lungs of ferrets inoculated with the seasonal H1N1 virus A appeared mostly normal, whereas A/California/04/2009-infected ferrets had more severe bronchopneumonia with prominent expression of viral antigen in the peribronchial glands and in a few alveolar cells. Similarly, ferrets inoculated with a pandemic H1N1 isolate from the Netherlands had mild to moderate, multi-focal, necrotizing rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis on day 3 p.i. with viral antigen observed in many cells in the nasal cavity, trachea, bronchus, and bronchioles while the pathologic changes and the presence of viral antigen were limited to the upper respiratory tract and were less extensive, respectively, in ferrets inoculated with seasonal H1N1 influenza [176] . By day 7 p.i., most of the virus-infected cells had been cleared from the respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated with either the seasonal or pandemic H1N1 virus. The pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses were also found to efficiently transmit via direct contact and respiratory droplets. In summary, the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses replicated more efficiently than seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses in the lower respiratory tract of ferrets. This increased level of replication was associated with more severe pathologic changes in the lower respiratory tract, but did not generally result in more severe clinical illness.As described above, there have been several reports of the use of non-human primate species as models for studies of influenza infection and for the evaluation of experimental influenza vaccines. To date, there is only one report of infection of non-human primates with pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses. Itoh and colleagues studied the infection of cynomolgus macaques with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus [171] . As with the previous studies of avian H5N1 influenza viruses in this model, multiple routes of inoculation were used to establish infection: animals were inoculated with a total dose of 10 7.4 PFU via the intratracheal, intranasal, ocular and oral routes. Macaques inoculated with the A/California/04/ 2009 (H1N1) virus experienced a greater increase in body temperature than animals that received a recent seasonal H1N1 virus, but they exhibited no other clinical signs of infection. The pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus replicated more efficiently in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of macaques, achieving titers of between 10 4.3 and 10 6.9 PFU in the lungs on day 3 p.i. High titers of virus (>10 5 PFU) were still detected in the oro/nasopharynx, tonsil and bronchi of one animal on day 7 p.i., but it had been cleared from the other respiratory tissues.Pathologic changes were observed in animals inoculated with either pandemic or seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses, but these lesions were more severe in the animals that received the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus.

Infected sentinel cats did not have detectable virus in tissues outside the respiratory tract; however, pathological changes were observed in the adrenal glands in one of the two sentinel cats infected in this manner. These studies demonstrated that HPAI H5N1 viruses are capable of extrapulmonary spread in cats, and can cause severe disease and even death in animals infected intratracheally or by feeding on infected bird carcasses. These observations also raise the possibility that the gastrointestinal tract may serve as a source for HPAI infection in cats.Karaca et al. [160] studied the immunogenicity of a fowlpox-based H5 vaccine in cats. HAI antibodies were detected in serum of cats following a single subcutaneous dose of the vaccine, and a significant boost in antibody titers was observed following a second vaccination.It remains to be seen if cats will be used extensively in the evaluation of vaccines against pandemic influenza.Saito and colleagues conducted a study to evaluate the replication and pathogenicity of influenza viruses of various subtypes in Syrian hamsters [161] . The influenza A/HK/1073/99 (H9N2) virus replicated to high titers in the lungs, but was not lethal to hamsters and was not detected in the brain. The HPAI H5N1 influenza A/HK/ 483/97 virus, that was highly virulent in mice, was also lethal in hamsters, with all animals succumbing to infection by day 6 p.i., and, as in mice, virus was recovered from the brain of the infected hamsters. Avian H9N2 and H9N5 isolates could replicate in the lungs of hamsters, but did so to lower titers compared to human isolates. The human H9N2 virus elicited low levels of neutralizing antibody in infected hamsters, whereas the avian H9N2 isolate did not elicit detectable neutralizing antibody. The behavior of this limited number of AI isolates in the Syrian hamster model suggests that the effects of this viruses may be similar to that observed in mice, and further evaluation of this model for evaluating the efficacy of pandemic influenza vaccines is warranted.There is renewed interest in the use of non-human primates for immunogenicity studies of pandemic vaccines; this is based on the presumption that immune responses in these animals, which have a closer evolutionary relationship to humans, may be more predictive of the responses in humans than in smaller animals like mice and ferrets. To date, few data are available on the serological responses of non-human primates to AI virus vaccines.The use of cynomolgus macaques as a model for influenza virus infection in humans was revisited following the emergence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 AI viruses in 1997 [162] . The initial human H5N1 influenza isolate, A/Hong Kong/ 156/1997, isolated from a fatal case of influenza in a child [6] , was inoculated at multiple sites, including the trachea, tonsils and conjunctiva. Three of four animals developed fever within 2 days, and one showed signs of anorexia and acute respiratory distress. High titers of virus were recovered from lungs on day 4 p.i., and the virus was also isolated from the trachea, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and the heart. The virus was not recovered from these tissues on day 7 p.i. The virus was also recovered from bronchioalveolar lavage from 2 out of 2 animals on days 3 and 5 p.i.; from pharyngeal swabs of two animals on day 5 p.i., and from nasal swabs of one animal on days 3 and 7. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in the brains of two animals on day 4 p.i., and in the spleen of all four animals tested on day 7 p.i. Pathological changes in the lungs of infected animals included pulmonary consolidation, necrotizing broncho-interstitial pneumonia and flooding of alveoli with edema fluid, fibrin, erythrocytes, cell debris, macrophages, and neutrophils, and inflammatory changes were seen in multiple organs [163] .Infection of Rhesus macaques with avian H5N1 isolates, reported by Chen et al. [164] , indicated that results of intranasal inoculation varied depending on the influenza virus isolate used. Clinical signs of infection, including elevation in body temperature, anorexia and increased respiratory rate were observed in macaques inoculated with the following H5N1 viruses: A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1/ 2005, A/great cormorant/Qinghai/3/2005 and A/duck/Guangxi/35/2001.

21,What is the uniqueness of the invariant probability measure in the Markov process?,"[' there exists a constant ε i ą 0 such thatfor all t P r0, 8q. In [15] , the authors provide a list of some probability distributions satisfying the assumption (H1), and show that the constraint conditions of (H1) are very weak. Specifically, they provide the phase-type distribution (PH-distribution) of a nonnegative random variable, and prove that this PH-distribution, or at most an approximation of it, satisfies the conditions in (H1). Thus, they conclude that essentially the conditional holding time distribution of the semi-Markov process can be any distribution on r0, 8q. Remark 1. Let us note that in the case of exponential (memoryless) sojourn time distribution, the semi-Markov process trptq, t ě 0u degenerates into a continuous time Markov chain. That is, if F i ptq "" 1´e´q it for some q i ą 0, i P M, thenfor all t P r0, 8q, from whichwhere q i,j is the transition rates from state i to state j, and q i,Thus, the matrix Q "" pq i,j q mˆm generates the Markov chain trptq, t ě 0u, i.e.,where ∆t ą 0 represents a small time increment.

Let us introduce the process ηptq "" t´suptu ă t : rpuq ‰ rptqu, which represents the amount of time the process trptq, t ě 0u is at the current state after the last jump. It is also denoted as the backward recurrence time process. The pair tpηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u satisfies the Markov property [17] , moreover it is strong Markov [10, Chapter 6].Let us consider a SAIRS model with vaccination, as in [20] .Let us now incorporate the impact of the external random environments into system (1) . We assume that the external random environment is described by a semi-Markov process. We only consider the environmental influence on the disease transmission rate since it may be more sensitive to environmental fluctuations than other parameters of model (1) . Thus, the average value of the transmission rate may switch between different levels with the switching of the environmental regimes. As a result, the SAIRS deterministic model (1) evolves in a random dynamical system with semi-Markov switching of the formLet us introduceβ :"" pβ A , β I q. If the initial conditions of the driving process tpηptq, rptqq, t ě 0u are ηp0q "" 0 and rp0q "" r 0 , then system (2) starts from the initial condition pSp0q, Ap0q, Ip0q, Rp0qq and follows (1) withβ ""βpr 0 q until the first jump time τ 1 , with conditional holding distribution F r0 p¨q. Then, the environmental regime switches instantaneously from state r 0 to state r 1 ; thus, the process restarts from the state r 1 and the system evolves accordingly to (1) withβ ""βpr 1 q and distribution F r1 p¨q until the next jump time τ 2 .

This means that if we start with any initial probability measure, and let the process evolve according to its transition function, the resulting probability measure will converge to the invariant probability measure as time goes on. This property is a fundamental characteristic of a Markov process, and it is what allows us to use the invariant probability measure as a"
57,Is there an association between maternal depressive symptoms and breastfeeding practice?,"["" forgotten, and efforts need to include reaffirming the benefits of breastfeeding among our health care workers. Evidence suggests that health care workers' infant feeding advice is undermined by implementing national guidelines within local contexts and fears of HIV transmission [36] . Aside from the nutritional superiority, the safety and immune benefits of breastmilk may need to be asserted to counter concerns during the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Support for breastfeeding cannot be distanced from support for the mother. Social protection policies such as the child support grant top-up and the COVID-19 social relief of distress grant in South Africa can assist women to reduce hunger while breastfeeding. In addition, mothers need reassurance about the quality of their breastmilk and their ability to breastfeed. Health care professionals and community health workers are trusted experts in this context and should be empowered to support breastfeeding mothers.This study sought to investigate whether recently improved breastfeeding rates [3] were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown-associated changes in economic and social circumstances and to assess the association between breastfeeding, maternal depressive symptoms, maternal hunger, and clinic visits. No association was found between breastfeeding practice and maternal depressive symptoms in this study. The results show that hunger and not attending the clinic were associated with reduced breast-feeding. This confirms the importance of adequate nutrition, access to health care, and other structural barriers to breastfeeding uptake.""]",No association was found between breastfeeding practice and maternal depressive symptoms in this study.,"Based on the information provided, there was no significant association found between maternal depressive symptoms and breastfeeding practice in the study.

203,What other information does the Skyeng information system collect besides teachers' self-reported gender and birth date?,"[' affected by social desirability bias, and vulnerable to memory error [41] [42] [43] . In contrast, digital trace data offer detailed real-time observation of individual actions 43 , as well as enable retrospective data collection. In this paper, we use information about exact paid working hours of online school teachers. Besides the workload, which plays a primary role in their earnings, teachers\' financial compensation in this online school has been a complex function of multiple adjacent factors, such as platform experience and student satisfaction. Since we do not have information on the exact size of teachers\' financial compensation, we focus exclusively on their workload in this paper.Our analysis addresses a set of three research questions. Based on previous findings on women\'s lower workload in traditional jobs 4, 16 , we hypothesize that this tendency might also hold in the gig economy. Conversely, the flexibility online platforms have come to provide through gig economy jobs might diminish the motherhood penalty 33 . Hence, we arrive at our first research question: RQ1: Are there statistically significant disparities in workload between the male and female gig economy teachers?Since workload has been directly associated with pay in this type of work, the answer to RQ1 could help explain the gender pay gap 30 . Less is known about changes in the gender gap over individuals\' life cycles. Goldin 33 demonstrated that while men and women began their employment with relatively similar earnings, the gender pay gap soon widened in men\'s favor, then narrowed as individuals reached their forties. In other words, the disparity in earnings between male and female workers significantly increased during their first few decades of working life. This gap could be related to a lack of human capital accumulation during the childbirth period 44 . In traditional jobs, whitecollar women reported higher levels of stress than men, and this level increased with the number of children. Moreover, the peak of this stress was reached in the period of 35-39 years 45 . Gupta and Smith 44 suggested that ""flexible work-time scheduling, part-time work, home-based work or work-sharing during leaves may be solutions to the problems of depreciation of human capital and the loss of human capital accumulation associated with leave periods"".In the present study, we gauge the gender gap among gig economy workers in different age groups, which leads to our second research question:RQ2: Are there statistically significant disparities in workload among the men and women in different age groups?Finally, workload disparities between men and women could be related to time arrangements during the workday. Unlike traditional work, the gig economy theoretically allows individuals to organize their work hours conveniently around their routine. Women have been less likely than men to work evenings due to caregiving and housework responsibilities 4, 15 , and the gig economy gives them the opportunity to work at more suitable times. Our third research question is thus as follows:RQ3: Are there statistically significant disparities in the distribution of work hours between men and women? In this article, we consider the data on more than 6 millions English lessons given to adult students over the 78-weeks period from January 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020. We analysed only completed lessons (87.2% of all planned lessons). The data includes information regarding teachers\' self-reported gender and birth date. The Skyeng information system also gathers information on teachers\' time zones.Data. Skyeng is the largest online English-language school in Eastern Europe (https:// skyeng. eu/). It offers one-on-one, 50-min online lessons. Anyone can sign up as a client at Skyeng. The Skyeng recommendation system matches students and teachers based on their time preferences (adjusted to time zones) and language level. Students and teachers might be in different time zones. The system offers students a small pool of teachers from which to select. Either the teacher or student may cancel individual lessons or stop lessons altogether.Admitted teachers have to open at least 12 hourly slots for the lessons at registration. However, they are allowed to adjust their workload and working hours accordingly afterward.This article covers automatically collected log data on English lessons given to adult students from January 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020. Our data set consists of 6,461,404 lessons given by 13,571 teachers to 216,285 students. We considered completed lessons only (87.2% of all planned lessons).

160,What's the connection between predicted mutational effects and protein expression in SARS-CoV-2's RBD domain?,"[' sequences extracted from GISAID to estimate the empirical variability among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains and to test our predictions. Note that these data are independent from the data used in the first step. In both approaches, IND and DCA, we thus use the MSA of distant homologs to learn a familyspecific sequence landscape ( ! , . . . , ! ), or ""statistical energy"", which provides low values to good (functional), and high values to bad (non-functional) sequences. In this context, ( ! , . . . , ! ) stands for an aligned sequence, i.e. the entries may be any of the 20 natural amino acids or an alignment gap. Any variant containing one or more mutations with respect to the reference sequence in Wuhan-Hu-1, can now be characterized by the statistical-energy change = ( ) − ( ) assigning positive values to variants predicted to be beneficial, and negative values to variants predicted to be deleterious. To obtain a position-specific (but not amino-acid specific) mutability score, we average over all amino-acid changes in this position reachable by a single nucleotide mutation, see Materials and Methods for the precise definition of ( ! , . . . , ! ) and the derived mutability scores. For testing these mutability scores, we use the same 39 protein domains for extracting a second MSA with variants of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID database. To minimize frequency biases due to the extremely heterogeneous sequencing efforts in different countries, we decided to remove redundant amino-acid sequences and keep each distinct sequence only once. The positionspecific observed variability is now defined as the number of distinct sequences in the resulting MSA having a mutation in the position under consideration, when compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference amino-acid sequences (see Materials and Methods for more details).In the case of the RBD, these data (predicted mutability and observed variability) are complemented with the experimental measures for protein expression, used as a proxy for protein stability by Starr et al. (25) . This type of data currently exists only for the RBD; we therefore decided to use the RBD for extensive validation of our predictions, and to report predictions for the other 38 domains only at the end of the Results section.To assess our prediction framework, we proceed with the following steps. First, we show that the mutational effect predictions of single-site amino-acid mutations are correlated with the protein expression changes measured in the before-mentioned deep mutational scan. Second, we show that the RBD variants available in the GISAID database are significantly more neutral than a randomized sequence library of the same sequence divergence from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference, the latter showing an accumulation of deleterious mutations. These two observations allow us to use predicted close-to-neutrality of a position as an indicator of its high mutability, while positions predicted to have mostly deleterious mutations are expected to be of low mutability. We use extensive comparisons with the sequence variability derived from GISAID to test this hypothesis.As a first test, we compare the agreement of the computationally predicted mutational effects with the experimental protein expression. Taking into consideration the region of the RBD domain defined by the Pfam profile bCoV_S1_RBD (PF09408, aligned length = 178), we compare our predictions with the experimentally measured single-site mutations. We focus on the positionspecific mutability, obtained by averaging both predictions and experiments over all accessible amino-acid changes in a position (Materials and Methods). The DCA model is well correlated with experimental expression ( Fig . In brief, we observe that the protein expression and the epistatic model are well correlated, notably better than for the independent model. We note that the model predicts some mutations to be deleterious, which are neutral in the expression experiments. Two reasons are possible: (a) in limited datasets of functional sequences, undersampled neutral variants may appear deleterious; and (b) mutations without effect on expression may be deleterious for other phenotypes contributing to protein fitness. This observation agrees with what has been observed across other protein families (30) (31) (32) , where phenotypes better describing fitness also correlate better to sequence-based predictions. Our DCA and IND models are built from MSAs of diverged species, where we explicitly remove sequences similar to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference (Materials and Methods) to avoid overlaps with the GISAID sequences used to estimate the local SARS-CoV-2 observed variability. We compare how fit, according to the DCA model, the natural sequences are compared to sequences having the same number of random mutations. This can be achieved by comparing the statistical-energy differences = ( ) − ( ) between the two sets of sequences. Fig. 2B shows that the natural SARS-CoV-']",The computationally predicted mutational effects in SARS-CoV-2's RBD domain are correlated with the experimental protein expression.,"The connection between predicted mutational effects and protein expression in SARS-CoV-2's RBD domain is that deep mutational scanning data has been used to measure how amino acid mutations of the RBD affect protein expression, which serves as a proxy for protein stability. This data has been incorporated into computational predictions to investigate the relationship between mutations and their impact on protein expression in the RBD domain of the virus.","What's the connection between predicted mutational effects and protein expression in SARS-CoV-2's RBD domain? ->: The connection between predicted mutational effects and protein expression in SARS-CoV-2's RBD domain is that deep mutational scanning data has been used to measure how amino acid mutations of the RBD affect protein expression, which serves as a proxy for protein stability.

The connection between predicted mutational effects and protein expression in SARS-CoV-2's RBD domain is that the predicted mutational effects can influence protein expression. For example, if a mutation in the RBD domain is predicted to have a large effect on protein expression, it may lead to changes in the stability or folding of the protein, which can affect its expression levels. Additionally, changes in protein expression"

Forty per cent of NHS doctors 5 reported psychological and emotional conditions before the pandemic [3] , with GPs in particular experiencing high 6 levels of burnout [4, 5] . 7 8 COVID-19 brought about many adaptations to general practice, including a rapid transition to e-consultations, 9 creation of 'hot' and 'cold' clinics (those examining patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and those addressing 10 unrelated needs), managing the manifestations of the pandemic in their practice, managing risk, and responding to 11 rapidly evolving guidelines. Indeed, high levels of stress and burnout amongst GPs during the COVID19 pandemic 12 have been reported internationally, with an expanding literature on this topic (e.g. [6] [7] [8] . Two UK studies of GP 13 pandemic experiences show greater work stress due to rapid change and uncertainty [9] and the importance of 14 teams in creating a sense of solidarity [10] . These studies are relatively small - Trivedi [9] studied 111 GPs in 15Leicestershire and Wanat et al [10] is a cross-European qualitative interview study of primary care staff, but includes 16 only seven GPs in England. Research studying the pandemic experiences of a national sample of UK GPs is needed. 17 18 Social media use by health professionals has become increasingly widespread [11, 12] and this has expanded during 19 the pandemic; Twitter is one of the most common types of social media platform [13] [14] [15] . Increasing numbers of GPs 20 are using social media, and increasing frequency of posts provides a useful tool for ascertaining their personal views 21 and experiences. Doctors use Twitter to discuss, rapidly and informally, current issues pertinent to their work and to 22 communicate with colleagues [13] . Unsurprisingly, this has focused recently on issues related to COVID-19 and work 23 practices [16] . Analysis of Twitter posts is used commonly to identify public experiences and opinions, including 24 recently on COVID-19 and its impact [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .Medical professionals' opinions about COVID-19 have been studied 25 using social media [32] , but no studies to date have examined GP wellbeing using social media monitoring, which is 26 the aim of this study. 27 28 Methods 29 30 Firstly, we sought to explore trends pre-and post-COVID using a longitudinal analysis of GPs' tweet content (January 31 2019 to February 2021).

187,What evaluation was done to assess the effectiveness of IB-DSS in fault diagnosis?,"["" the fault diagnosis of the safetypins. To compare and benchmark the fault diagnosis, we chose the well-known VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) architecture. In both tasks, image augmentation was used to improve the generalization of the models. For object detection the brightness of the images was randomly adjusted. For the classification task, where cropped images of safetypins were classified, we applied horizontal and vertical flipping, random brightness adjustment, width as well as height range shifting, and random image blurring.The component detectors were implemented using the Tensorflow 3 DL framework 4 (Abadi et al. 2015) with models pretrained on the MS COCO dataset (Lin et al. 2014) . The image classifiers were realized using the Keras DL library 5 (Chollet et al. 2015) which provides image classification models pretrained on the ILSVRC dataset (Russakovsky et al. 2015) .For the evaluation of DF1-DF3 and DP1 and DP2 respectively, we conducted both an artificial evaluation to closely assess the pipeline's efficacy and efficiency as well as a naturalistic evaluation to generally judge the design's acceptance and usefulness. In accordance, the evaluation episodes were guided by the questions below: Artificial evaluation of the model component (EE I.I) The efficiency evaluation of the proposed pipelines required two considerations. First, the pipeline's ability to detect the chosen components needed to be evaluated. Second, the accuracy of the fault diagnosis -which we performed for detected safetypins -had to be assessed.Evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the detection task in terms of average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP) (Rafael Padilla and da Silva 2020), we compared our proposed MSCD to the SSCD pipeline. As we were working with our own proprietary dataset DS Ro , the available images were split into a training set comprising 80% of the data, with the remaining 20% used for the evaluation set. To increase the evaluation's validity, images captured at one tower were held out from the random split and solely utilized for the evaluation dataset, while maintaining the split ratio. This image-level split was kept consistent across the derived datasets DS1 Co and DS2 Fi . The SSCD pipeline was fine-tuned to detect the respective component classes using the DS Ro dataset. Accordingly, both detection stages of the MSCD pipeline were fine-tuned on DS1 Co and DS2 Fi respectively. All models were trained using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer with 0.0003 (Faster R-CNN) and 0.001 (SSD) initial learning rate respectively, 0.9 momentum, and batch size 64. We determined the models by using early stopping on the validation loss with a patience of 100 for all models. The testing results of the different pipelines using the different architectures are shown in Fig. 6 . The performance for the safetypin class is disclosed in terms of inter pipeline performance for both the SSCD and the MSCD pipeline as well as the intra pipeline performance for solely the MSCD pipeline.We evaluated the fault diagnosis task performed for the safetypins class in terms of weighted precision, weighted recall, and weighted F 1 -score (Pedregosa et al. 2011) to account for class imbalance. We applied a 3-fold cross validated grid-search to identify the optimal combination of parameters. We chose to account for the following parameter: unfrozen convolutional layers, dense layer size, optimizer and its respective learning rate, dropout rate, and batch size. The images in dataset DS3 Pi were shuffled, a hold out set containing 10% of the images was retained and the remaining images were split into 3 folds. Consequently, for each grid search configuration three models were trained with early stopping with patience 30. The best resulting model of the Resnet and VGG16 model were harnessed to be evaluated on the retained hold out set. The results of the evaluation of the cropped safetypin classification task based on the test set are shown in Table 6 . All details on the machine learning steps and choices are depicted within Sect. A2 in the Appendix (Kühl et al. 2021) .Naturalistic evaluation of the model component (EE I.II)To answer whether the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs help MEs, we conducted nine purposefully sampled (Coyne 1997) interviews with potential users of the IB-DSS from our case company.

Many reported receiving their COVID-19 vaccination. 7 8 Risk 9Some GPs resigned themselves to 'inevitably' catching COVID-19. GPs commented that they were more vulnerable 10 than other professions such as shop workers and those in secondary care, stating that 90% of patient contact is with 11GPs and contact is at closer proximity. Concerns around risk to BAME GPs centred around the disproportionately 12 higher death rate in BAME GPs and calls for 'appropriate measures' to be put in place. These views were more 13 commonplace among BAME GPs. 14 Once the vaccine was available, some GPs were frustrated by delays to their own vaccination. 15In terms of concern for family members, some GPs talked about 'living in fear of unknowingly passing it on to my 16 family and loved ones', particularly more vulnerable family members. 17Communication 18There was praise for primary care teams 'pulling together' and a clear sense of 'solidarity', alongside comments 19 about how well community teams and volunteer/good neighbour schemes worked with GPs. While closer working 20 relationships between primary and secondary care were referenced in some posts, there was a realisation that this 21 was much needed. A 'Berlin Wall' and a 'them and us mentality' was described between primary and secondary care. 22Criticisms of hospital communications included hospitals 'bouncing back' GP referrals, and delays in patient test 23 results. There were calls for better IT systems and for secondary care staff to spend time in primary care. Some 24 praised technology and 'online channels' that enabled improved communication and made the situation more 25 'bearable'. 26Pleas were also made for better communication between the NHS and government, particularly as GPs had no 27 warning of policy announcements such as shielding changes, and flu and COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs. 28GPs were very aware of the potential impact of the pandemic on their mental health; some reported looking after 30 themselves, mostly through exercise and eating well, as well as some 'self-care' activities. The importance of taking 31 annual leave and having days off 'even in the middle of a pandemic' was also emphasized. 32Others, though, disliked the 'self-care mantra' and felt resilience planning was insufficient to 'reverse the 33 unprecedented levels of stress faced by primary care doctors today'. 34 .

The analysis reveals trends in the social commentaries made by GPs during the pandemic, 5including issues pertinent to GPs that may have affected their wellbeing. In our quantitative analysis, amongst a 6 number of interesting patterns observed over this period, those of particular note relate to the strength of feeling 7 around protection, risk and testing during the first wave of the pandemic; communication issues with and lack of 8 appreciation by government, secondary care and the public, and peaks in commentary during the initial COVID-19 9 vaccine rollout. Similarly, our qualitative thematic analysis revealed key issues around perceived lack of resources 10 and support, which had implications for GPs' safety, workload and wellbeing. Perceived lack of support from 11 government, media and the public affected their morale. 12Our analysis identified comments about wellbeing which in 2019 were more predominantly related to patients, 14whereas 2020 saw more focus on GP wellbeing. Posts related to coping commonly reflected work pressures and 15 fluctuated throughout the time period studied, suggesting that such views were prevalent well before the pandemic. 16Our qualitative findings highlight the perceived sources of increased workload and stress during the pandemic, 17including rapid moves to remote working (with remote consultations described as taking longer), GP self-isolation or 18 shielding increasing pressures on colleagues, poor or confusing dissemination of policy guidance, increased patients 19with mental health problems, time taken cleaning and donning/doffing PPE.

Architectures such as VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) and ResNet (He et al. 2015a) for image classification and Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) and SSD (Liu et al. 2016 ) for object detection have proven to provide good accuracy at resonable inference time.CV is utilized for infrastructure inspection in many application domains. The typical challenges addressed with CV in this area are cases where large amounts of physical objects are to be inspected and they are geographically remote and / or dispersed. Selected research articles are presented in the following and summarized in Table 1. A major application area is road surface inspection and maintenance. Roads in bad condition can ultimately result in more accidents and higher costs (Baladi et al. 2017; Gleave et al. 2014) . Thus, CV is utilized to automatically assess road surface condition and derive necessary maintenance actions. Over the last years this became possible without expensive, specialized hardware (compare, e.g., Quintana et al. 2016) . Chatterjee et al. (2018) show how machine learning-based CV can be used to detect road surface cracks and develop a ''vision-based DSS for crack detection''. They offer first insights into a nascent design theory for the application case of road crack detection on the basis of images.Not only roads, but also railways need to be inspected periodically to ensure safe transports. Wei et al. (2019) employ a Faster R-CNN to detect defects of railway track fasteners. Gibert et al. (2017) propose a CNN-based multitask learning approach that detects railway track fasteners and crossties and classifies the state of these components.Wind turbine blades are another physical object of interest for CV-based infrastructure inspection. Akhloufi and Benmesbah (2014) present a CV approach to identify ice accreation on wind turbine blades. Ice accreation can require a maintenance action since it can cause malfunction and premature wear and is a safety hazard for nearby people and infrastructure like roads and powerlines. Shihavuddin et al. (2019) show how faults like leading edge erosion can be detected with a Faster R-CNN on wind turbine blades.In this work, we are particularly interested in CV solutions for power line inspection relying on UAV images. From a component-based view, power line inspection can be divided into four major categories: towers or poles, insulators, conductors, and fittings (Liu et al. 2020) . Each of these categories contains several subcomponents (Nguyen et al. 2018 ) that typically vary in size, kind, and material according to the voltage level. For instance, some part of a distribution network with low voltage might have wooden poles, small standing insulators, and a single, relatively thin conductor. On the other hand, transmission networks usually have lattice steel towers, large suspending insulators, and thicker conductors. Several studies have been published that utilize various potential platforms (e.g., helicopter, satellite, and UAV) to collect different data types (e.g., optical images, laser scanner data, thermal images, and synthetic aperture radar images) and analyzed these (Matikainen et al. 2016) . The vision-based approach -with image data from the visible spectrum captured by UAVs and automatically analyzed through image processing capabilities -has gained the most attention and traction in the power line inspection research domain (Liu et al. 2020) . With a few exceptions, automated vision-based power line inspection based on UAV-captured images requires two inherently related tasks (Liu et al. 2020) : component detection and localization as well as fault diagnosis. The exceptions relate to objects such as bird nests, whose detection already represents a fault. Previous research applying image processing for the detection and fault diagnosis of PLCs is numerous (Mirallès et al. 2014) . Liu et al. (2020) identify several characteristics and shortcomings of previous studies using UAV-captured images in their exhaustive literature review. Most studies in the field of vision-based inspection of power lines focus on the insulator and its faults (Liu et al. 2020 ) -mainly missing caps (e.g., Sampedro Pérez et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019; Zhai et al. 2018 ) -while little attention has been paid to other components. The safety pin that prevents other components from loosening and falling is the smallest object in the power line and has, despite its importance, received little attention and has only been regarded in fault diagnosis but not in the detection step. Finally, both Liu et al. (2020) and Nguyen et al. (2018) conclude that the mediocre performance of task-specific approaches presented in the vast majority of studies has been superseded by DL approaches that have improved""]",Road surface inspection and maintenance,A specific application area for computer vision in assessing and deriving maintenance actions for road surfaces is in the detection of road surface cracks.

We identified all primary MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia during March-November 2014 by excluding those with history of exposure to other cases of MERS-CoV or acute respiratory illness of unknown cause or exposure to healthcare settings within 14 days before illness onset. Using a case-control design, we assessed differences in underlying medical conditions and environmental exposures among primary case-patients and 2-4 controls matched by age, sex, and neighborhood. Using multivariable analysis, we found that direct exposure to dromedary camels during the 2 weeks before illness onset, as well as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and smoking, were each independently associated with MERS-CoV illness. Further investigation is needed to better understand animal-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.M iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly recognized respiratory pathogen first identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia in June 2012 (1) . MERS-CoV causes acute respiratory disease that has a high case-fatality rate (2) . All cases have been linked to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula; >85% of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia (2) . Outbreaks of MERS-CoV have been associated primarily with transmission in healthcare settings (3) (4) (5) . Transmission among household contacts of case-patients has been documented (6) , but sustained human-to-human transmission has not (7) . Low-level infections with MERS-CoV have been reported, but seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in the general population in Saudi Arabia is low (8) . Strategies to prevent and control infection are recommended to limit secondary transmission in healthcare settings and among household contacts (9, 10) . MERS-CoV cases continue to be reported in Saudi Arabia in healthcare settings and in the community (2) .Animals have been suspected as a source of primary infection since early in the emergence of MERS-CoV, particularly given the similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, a zoonosis known to cause human respiratory disease, often severe, with sustained human-tohuman transmission and amplification in healthcare settings (11) . Persons with early cases of MERS-CoV infection were observed to have had exposure to dromedary camels (henceforth dromedaries), and subsequent serologic studies from the Arabian Peninsula confirmed high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in dromedaries (12) (13) (14) . Other studies have detected partial genome sequences of MERS-CoV from dromedary specimens (15) (16) (17) , and more recently infectious MERS-CoV has been isolated from dromedaries (16, (18) (19) (20) (21) . Additionally, a recent report provided virologic and serologic evidence of transmission of MERS-CoV from a sick dromedary to a human in Saudi Arabia (19) .Despite these reports, risk factors for primary illness with MERS-CoV (i.e., cases in persons without apparent exposure to other infected persons) are not well understood.No risk factors for primary transmission of MERS-CoV to humans have been confirmed by epidemiologic studies, including a link with exposure to dromedaries or any other animal species. We conducted a case-control study to assess exposures in primary cases and to identify risk factors associated with primary MERS-CoV illness in humans.In Saudi Arabia, all laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases are reported to the Ministry of Health (MoH) and routinely investigated to assess preillness exposures. All cases reported during March 16-November 13, 2014, were screened for inclusion. For cases reported before May 13, 2014, a confirmed case was defined as illness in any person hospitalized with bilateral pneumonia and laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection on the basis of a positive real-time reverse transcription PCR targeting 2 genes: the upstream of E gene and the open reading frame 1a gene (22) . The case definition was revised on May 13, after which a confirmed case was defined as laboratory confirmation and any 1 of the following 4 clinical definitions: 1) fever and community-acquired pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome based on clinical or radiologic evidence; 2) healthcare-associated pneumonia based on clinical and radiologic evidence in a hospitalized person; 3a) acute febrile (>38°C) illness, b) body aches, headache, diarrhea, or nausea/vomiting, with or without respiratory symptoms, and c) unexplained le']",The focus of the study conducted in Saudi Arabia regarding MERS-CoV illness is to identify risk factors associated with primary MERS-CoV illness in humans.,"The focus of the study conducted in Saudi Arabia regarding MERS-CoV illness was to identify the risk factors for primary Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in humans.

157,How does the combination of CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 RBM antibodies enhance potency and reduce escape mutants?,"[' in each study. In addition, Huo et al. validated their neutralization assays with multiple rounds of PRNT against three different batches of CR3022 (with and without washing after adsorption). CR3022 has been shown to bind to a conserved epitope distinct from the RBM [68, 69] (Figure 2A) . Thus, CR3022 can be used in combination with antibodies directly targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RBM to provide synergy in potency as well as to limit the likelihood of escape mutants of the virus [66] .Wrapp et al. [39] immunized a llama against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 S proteins in successive rounds to develop a lead cross-neutralizing camelid nanobody VHH-72, with efficacy against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. Although VHH-72 showed relatively high binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 S VSV pseudotypes by VHH-72 had a higher IC 50 than for SARS-CoV-1 pseudotypes. The team reasoned this is because of the high dissociation rate constant between VHH-72 and RBD. To circumvent this issue, a bivalent format of VHH-72, VHH-72-Fc (fragment crystallizable region), was constructed [39] . The new format showed improved binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in ELISA and succeeded in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S VSV pseudoviruses, exhibiting an IC 50 of~0.2 μg/ml. Structural analysis showed that VHH-72 binds to a region of RBD that partially overlaps with the CR3022 binding site (Figure 2A ). Unlike CR3022, VHH-72 prevents ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 [39] .An antibody reported by Pinto et al. [70] , S309, was developed from memory B cell screening of a SARS-CoV-1 recovered patient. Of eight potential candidates, S309 was shown to potently neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 (2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020, IC 50 =~79 ng/ml) through a mechanism that did not rely on host receptor (ACE2) blocking. The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure revealed that S309 recognizes a highly conserved N343-glycan-containing epitope that is not located on the ACE2-RBD interface, and is also distinct from the CR3022 epitope binding site ( Figure 2 ). S309 was tested in combination with a panel of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against different epitopes, resulting in enhanced neutralization potency (compared to any mAb alone) against both pseudovirions and authentic SARS-CoV-2 [70] . The observed synergy highlights the potential of using antibody cocktails to treat COVID-19.Wu et al. [45] also recently identified neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients (IC 50 values ranging from 0.177 to 1.375 μg/ml). B38, as well as H4, showed blocking of ACE2 receptor recognition by RBD (Figure 2 ) of SARS-CoV-2 in a BLI assay. In an epitope competition assay, both B38 and H4 bound to RBD, with partial inhibition against each other, suggesting that they target different epitopes on the RBD that only partially overlap. In vivo studies using human (h)ACE2 transgenic mice confirmed reduction of viral titer in the lungs and improved histopathology scores of mice administered with B38 compared to control and H4-treated groups [45] . Subsequent structural validation through cryo-EM confirms B38 binding to RBD, with an epitope that spans 36 residues on the RBD, of which 15 lie within the RBD/ACE2 interface ( Figure 2 ).Shi et al. [71] isolated one lead antibody, CB6, from convalescent COVID-19 patients. CB6 was found to recognize an epitope overlapping with the ACE2-binding site on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. CB6 exhibits strong neutralizing activity against live SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells, with an observed IC 50 of~0.036 μg/ml. Further study in a rhesus macaque SARS-CoV-2 infection model demonstrated that CB6 (50 mg/kg) inhibits viral titer (decreased from~']",The combination of CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 RBM antibodies enhances potency and reduces escape mutants by providing synergy in potency and limiting the likelihood of escape mutants of the virus.,"The combination of CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 RBM antibodies enhances potency and reduces escape mutants by targeting distinct epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

These results suggest meals purchased outside the home are lower in fruits and vegetables than those prepared within the home. Previous literature also demonstrated this relationship, with away from home meals associated with poorer diet quality and lower fruit and vegetable intakes among dyads [45] . The lack of a significant relationship between skin carotenoids and meals away from home at 3-and 6-months, may indicate improvements in dietary behaviors as a result of strategies learned through parental participation in WMP.Though this study has many strengths, including longitudinal data collection, a wellestablished adult WMP, enrollment of parent-child dyads, and objective indicators of fruit and vegetable consumption and height/weight, it is not without limitations. As a single-arm study, the lack of a control group limits the ability to determine the causal effect of the WMP on outcomes. Further, the small sample size, attrition, and homogeneity of participants as well as the use of a convenience sample may limit generalizability to other populations participating in adult weight management settings. The way that fruit and vegetable consumption was measured included combined increases in ""fruit and vegetable"" intake, and did not include the preparation of these foods (i.e., raw, processed, etc.). Bioavailability of carotenoids varies based upon the food matrix, processing conditions, preparation, and several other factors, lack of information on these details in this study impedes the ability to fully elucidate mechanisms that may have impacted changes in skin carotenoids over the course of the WMP, and thus results should be interpreted with caution [46] .

SARS-CoV-1 RBD), P384 (A in SARS-CoV-1 RBD), and A372 (T in SARS-CoV-1 RBD) are involved in binding to CR3022, and the non-conserved SARS-CoV-2 RBD epitope residue N439 (R in SARS-CoV-1 RBD) is involved in binding to VHH-72 ( Figure 2B ). Such interactions may explain the weakened binding affinities and crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein [16] . It is important to note here that neutralizing antibody induction is a key feature of many effective vaccines and hence is a crucial component to be considered in the design of a successful COVID-19 vaccine. Further understanding of the conserved neutralizing epitopes and associated conformational changes in SARS-CoV-2 S protein is urgently needed [46] because such information will promote effective vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.Cross-neutralization has also been reported with respect to convalescent studies. Ou et al. conducted cross-neutralization tests using SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 patient sera, which could neutralize their own pseudovirions but had limited ability to cross-neutralize [40] . By contrast, other convalescent studies showed successful cross-neutralization by serum antibodies. One study utilizing serum from SARS-CoV-1 convalescent patients, as well as rabbit sera raised against SARS-CoV-1 S protein, showed complete inhibition of SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped virus and slightly less efficient inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotype infection of Vero E6 cells (kidney epithelial cell line from African green monkey) [17] . In another study, murine polyclonal antibodies produced against SARS-CoV-1 S protein reduced transduction (PDB 6WPT [39] and PDB 6W41 [68] ), whereas that of VHH-72 is with RBD of SARS-CoV-1 (PDB 6WAQ [70] ).

1,How do functional changes in VSS affect visual processing in the brain?,"[' increase in alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is frequently observed in electrophysiological recordings. 36, 37 Alpha-gamma PAC dynamically coordinates brain activity over multiple spatial scales, 73, 74 such that gamma oscillations within local neuronal ensembles are coupled with large-scale patterns of low-frequency phase synchrony. 75 It is proposed that such dynamics allow information to be routed efficiently between brain areas and for neuronal representations to be segmented and maintained, e.g., during visual working memory. 76, 77 Following the presentation of a visual grating, we found that in VSS, alpha-gamma PAC in V1 was reduced compared to controls. This reduction occurred despite the VSS group displaying stronger visual gamma power in primary visual cortex. Interestingly, disruptions to PAC have also been reported in tinnitus, 78 although increased PAC has also been shown. 79 Our findings suggest that visual activity in VSS is both hyperexcitable (increased gamma power) and disorganised (reduced alpha-gamma PAC). Both results could be underpinned by an excitation-inhibition imbalance in visual cortex, as the neurophysiological generation of gamma amplitude and PAC relies heavily on local inhibitory populations of neurons. 80 Affected local inhibitory processes would produce high-frequency \'noisy\' activity and reduced signal-to-noise in perceptual systems, similar to findings reported in tinnitus. 16, 81 However, further corroborating evidence will be required before a definitive link between VSS, E-I interactions, and PAC can be confirmed. Disorganised local activity could also have concomitant effects on establishing inter-regional and global connectivity. 82 Where top-down mechanisms are affected in VSS, altered noise-cancelling (i.e., the ""gain"") of perceptual systems might result, 83, 84 meaning that typical visual stimuli would produce noisy and hyperactive responses in visual cortex, irrespective of their context. 1 Reduced noise cancelling could explain previous EEG findings of reduced habituation in VSS. 14 Future studies, specifically targeting perceptual gain and visual feedback pathways, 29, 85 should explore these ideas in more detail.From a clinical perspective, our novel findings of increased gamma power and reduced alpha-gamma PAC in VSS suggest that interventions targeting the re-establishment of typical rhythmical activity may help manage and treat the condition. Subject-specific neuromodulation approaches like repetitive TMS and cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation, 86 or neurofeedback approaches targeting gamma power and/or alphagamma PAC could be used for managing VS symptoms. 87, 88 Previous research has employed a range of imaging modalities to identify surrogate markers of brain dysfunction in VSS 89 . For example, using 18 Resting-state functional MRI data from a VSS cohort also showed hyperconnectivity between extrastriate and inferior temporal regions and between prefrontal and parietal cortex. 12 Research utilising structural and functional MRI has reported disruptions to a wide array of brain regions in VSS. For example, increases in grey matter volume are found in lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus junction, primary and secondary visual cortices, middle and superior temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. 6, 8, 12 Using functional MRI with a visual paradigm, Puledda and colleagues report decreased BOLD responses in VSS specific for the insula, which were interpreted as disruptions to the salience network. 6 Overall, regions overlapping with extrastriate visual cortex seem to be most commonly associated with VSS. 6, 8, 12, 89 These regions are responsible for high-level visual processing such as colour vision perception and are linked with palinopsia 2 : a symptom that was present in 94% of our cohort. Our data extend this work by showing how functional changes in VSS are present even earlier in the visual hierarchy (i.e., primary visual cortex). These low-level alterations might then propagate downstream to extrastriate regions and beyond.Finally, electrophysiological markers of VSS have reported a number of low-level differences versus controls, including increased N145 latency, 13 and reduced habituation. 14, 93 Our results build on this research by demonstrating differences in the endogenous rhythms of the brain during visual processing. Findings of reduced habituation in VSS are particularly interesting, as they suggest a disrupted noise-cancellation mechanism, which is unable to modulate hyperactive and noisy V1 activity.While this study has focussed on dysrhythmias measured from the cortex, it is also essential to consider other brain regions, such as the thalamus. Work over the last few decades suggests that the thalamus does not simply act as a relay station during sensory processing.Instead, there exists a robust network of cortico-thalamic feedback neurons that dynamically influence sensory processing. 94 One prominent theoretical account termed ""thalamocortical dysrhythmia"" (TCD) suggests that']","Functional changes in VSS affect visual processing in the brain by disrupting the noise-cancellation mechanism, modulating hyperactive and noisy V1 activity.","Functional changes in Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS) can affect visual processing in the brain in several ways.

These alterations may result from a faulty ""noise-canceling"" mechanism in the brain, similar to what occurs in tinnitus.

Functional changes in VSS can affect visual processing in the brain by altering the way visual information is processed and transmitted. For example, changes in VSS can affect the way visual stimuli are encoded and transmitted to other brain areas, such as the primary visual cortex, which is responsible for processing visual information. Additionally, changes in VSS can affect the way visual information is integrated with other sensory information, such as auditory or somatosensory information, which can impact the"

[100] . In addition, Gao et al. reported the presence of viral antigen in cardiac myofibers of mice infected with the highly virulent influenza A/HK/483/97 (H5N1) virus. The ability of the H5N1 viruses to replicate and cause disease and death in mice did not correlate with their ability to kill chickens [102] , and the relevance of replication of these viruses in extrapulmonary sites in mice to the disease in humans is not clear, although a general correlation between the level of virulence in mice and the severity and outcome of disease in humans was observed with 11 of 15 viruses evaluated [101] . Dybing and colleagues [103] [104] . In the same study, HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from birds, and a single human isolate, were less virulent for mice.Lu et al. [102] used the BALB/c mouse model to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of a vaccine against H5N1 influenza, based on an antigenically related non-pathogenic AI virus, A/duck/Singapore-Q/F119-3/97 (H5N3). They found that two doses of inactivated vaccine were required to elicit HAI antibody responses of a magnitude that would be protective in human influenza in the majority of vaccinated animals, and that the addition of an alum adjuvant resulted in higher levels of HAI antibody and a greater seroconversion rate. These findings generally agreed with the observations made in humans when a similar vaccine was tested in clinical studies: two doses of vaccine were necessary to achieve acceptable levels of antibody, and the addition of adjuvant, in this case MF59 (instead of alum used in the studies in mice), increased the magnitude of the antibody response as well as the seroconversion rate [105] [106] [107] . The efficacy of this vaccine in mice was determined by measuring the level of virus replication in the lungs and protection against lethal challenge with an H5N1 isolate that was highly virulent for mice.The efficacy of several different H5N1 virus vaccines has been evaluated in mice and in all cases, the vaccines were found to be immunogenic and protective in mice (reviewed in [108] ). When tested in Phase I studies in humans, inactivated H5N1 virus vaccines were found to be suboptimally immunogenic, requiring high doses [109, 110] to elicit neutralizing and HAI antibody responses. The administration of whole virion vaccines and inactivated virus vaccines with adjuvant increased the immunogenicity in mice and in humans [109, 111] . It is unclear whether data obtained in mice with pandemic influenza vaccines are predictive of vaccine immunogenicity in humans since pre-clinical data for the specific vaccine formulations that have been tested in humans to date have not been reported.Cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine candidates against H5N1 AI viruses have been evaluated in pre-clinical studies in mice [66] .

149,"What are the Mindset guidelines for responsible reporting of mental health and suicide, and how well do Canadian media articles about Veterans follow them?","[' alone with a focus on mental health issues such as PTSD or suicide. This is worrying for three reasons. First, it would be erroneous to assume that patterns of media reporting observed in the US are similar in Canada, with a recent study finding significant differences when comparing Canadian and US media reporting of Robin Williams\' suicide [27] . Second, the aforementioned research indicates that one-dimensional reporting of Veterans can perpetuate stereotypes and social distance; this can impede veteran reintegration into society, which has been identified as a policy priority in Canada [28] . Indeed, a large corpus of research indicates that media stereotyping of a group, for example people with mental illness or Veterans, can lead to increased levels of internal and external stigma [26, 29, 30] . Third, related research indicates that certain types of media reporting of suicide can lead to suicide contagion among demographically similar individuals−a phenomena known as the Werther effect [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .The Werther effect has been well-documented in many nations of the world [36] including Korea [37] , Austria [34, 38] , the US [31, 35] and Canada [39, 40] with a recent study indicating a 16% increase in Canadian suicides in the months following the death of Robin Williams [41] . Taken together, these studies indicate that the Werther effect is associated with various media-content related factors including (i) a focus on celebrity suicides; (ii) describing the suicide method in detail, especially asphyxiation and jumping; and (iii) sensationalized reporting of suicide.It is theorized that the Werther effect occurs because some vulnerable people may identify with the decedent and their struggles via social learning after consuming such media, which is intensified when the consumer perceives that the decedent is demographically alike (e.g. age and sex) and has a similar or elevated social status [31, 42, 43] . Such affinity, combined with sensational and detailed media coverage, may lead some vulnerable consumers to conclude that suicide is a feasible answer to ongoing struggles, leading to imitative suicidal behaviour [37, 41] .Conversely, the media can be a vector for increased awareness and education, such as pointing to available resources, highlighting stories of hope and recovery, and bringing attention to important social issues surrounding suicide [34, 40, [44] [45] [46] . Indeed, several research studies indicate a modest reduction in suicide mortality and suicidal ideation after suicide-related media reporting when the news focus has included content related to (i) mastery of crises; (ii) resilience in the face of adversity; and (iii) messages of hope and recovery [34, 39, 47, 48] This has been labelled \'the Papageno effect\' .Interestingly, several research studies, including two large-scale Canadian studies, indicate that media coverage of murder-suicides also leads to a reduction in suicide mortality, and is not associated with any Werther effect [39, 40] This may be because susceptible individuals tend not to identify with violent \'villains\' who ipso facto have a lowered social status and are typically presented unfavourably in the media [38] .Given this situation, the Mental Health Commission of Canada has sponsored the development and wide distribution of best practice guidelines to encourage the responsible reporting of mental health and suicide, known as Mindset, with the third edition published in 2020 [49] . These are available on a devoted website, and as a short booklet, with over 5000 distributed to journalists across Canada. Mindset includes bullet point lists of recommendations that attempt to guide the journalist to include protective information, while avoiding coverage that could lead to stigma and suicide contagion. For example, the third edition includes 16 bullet points related to writing about suicide including ""do not go into details about the method used"" and ""do tell others considering suicide how they can get help"", while there are seven mental illness bullet points including ""strive to include quotes from those affected or others like them"" and ""do not reinforce stereotypes (especially in headlines)"".Several studies have examined adherence to earlier editions of Mindset reporting guidelines in relation to generic media coverage of suicide and mental illness [45, 50] , but there has been little research examining Mindset in relation to Canadian Veterans. This lack of research is concerning, given the potential role of the media in influencing public stigma, as well as potentially contributing to the Werther effect and the Papageno effect.In an attempt to address this deficit, the overarching aim of this study is to assess the tone and content of Canadian media coverage of military Veterans, with a focus on PTSD and suicide. The first objective is to document and analyze common themes, content and temporal patterns in Canadian media articles about Veterans. The second objective is to examine common themes and content in the sub-set of articles which have PTSD as a theme. The third objective is to assess adherence to Mindset guidelines in the sub-set of articles which have Veteran suicide', "" there was strong adherence to many recommendations. For instance, no articles gave a monocausal explanation of suicide, nor glamorized or romanticized the suicide. Similarly, virtually no articles used discouraged words, phrases or sensational language and suicide experts were quoted in over half of the articles. However, there was low adherence to other recommendations. Less than 5% provided help-seeking information, only 13% tried to educate the public about suicide and broader issues, over 50% mentioned the suicide method used, and more than 1 in 3 mentioned the suicide location.The results reveal some encouraging findings as well as room for improvement regarding media coverage of Canadian Veterans. As stated in the introduction, an amassed corpus of US research indicates that the US media often focuses on factors such as trauma, emotional instability and drugs/alcohol when reporting Veterans, with a lack of positive stories and an emphasis on Veterans as victims [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, the present study indicates that the Canadian media typically represent Veterans in a positive manner, with a focus on commemoration and honour in over 50% of articles, often in reference to World War 2. Similarly, there is very little discussion of drug/alcohol abuse in the Canadian articles, and virtually no instances where journalists use stigmatizing language.Moreover, the articles about PTSD and suicide generally follow best practice guidelines, with high levels of adherence to the Mindset recommendations. This is consistent with other Canadian research on generic media coverage of mental illness and suicide, which shows that the Canadian media has significantly improved its coverage of these issues in recent years, with better adherence to core guidelines than the US media [27, 45, 50] .For example, the present study found that only 3% of articles about Veteran suicide included sensational language, 0 % attributed suicide to a single cause, 23% included 'suicide' in the headline, while 51% included a quote by a suicide expert, and 5% included help-seeking information. In contrast, a recent US study of media coverage of Veteran suicide found that 60% of articles included sensational/dramatic language, 60% attributed Veteran suicide to a single cause and 40% included 'suicide' in the headline, while 0 % contained help-seeking information or quoted suicide experts [22] . That said, the present paper reveals five issues regarding the pattern of reporting of Veterans in the Canadian media that may require further attention and action.First, articles about Veterans per se rarely discuss recently-discharged Veterans, except in the context of highly-anomalous cases such as Lionel Desmond and Jonathan Vance. Indeed, less than 10% of articles focused on Afghanistan Veterans, and many of these focused on Lionel Desmond. This is concerning, given that over 40,000 Canadian Forces personnel served in the Afghanistan theatre. Indeed, research indicates that many such Veterans have faced specific challenges making the transition to civilian life [28] , with some studies indicating that these Veterans are at high risk of suicide and social isolation [3, 4] . Greater and more diverse media coverage of Afghanistan Veterans may shine a spotlight on their specific issues, which in turn may catalyze positive social and institutional change. Moreover, some other Veterans are rarely featured in the media, including female Veterans, Royal Canadian Navy Veterans, and Royal Canadian Air Force Veterans. Again, this can lead to wider public ignorance about issues faced by such Veterans, and more holistic coverage may be beneficial. Second, the study indicates that articles about Veterans tend to cluster around key events during the course of a year, with Veterans remaining relatively invisible outside of these clusters. The first cluster appeared in the weeks surrounding Remembrance Day (November 11), accounting for over 50% of articles. The second cluster appeared in February/ March 2021, consisting of two sub-clusters (i) the inquest into the highly anomalous but newsworthy Lionel Desmond murder-suicide, and (ii) the sexual misconduct allegations leveled against military Veterans, especially General Jonathan Vance. Of note, the first cluster could be framed as a 'positive cluster' , as the weeks around Remembrance Day typically illuminate Veterans' sacrifices and their ongoing contribution to society. However, the two sub-clusters in 2021 could be framed as 'negative clusters' , as they focus on adverse phenomena including murder-suicide and sexual misconduct. Such a focus could skew wider public perceptions, leading readers to associate Veterans with behaviours and attitudes that are harmful to self and others. This suggests the importance of fair, balanced and accurate coverage of Veterans throughout the year, with the inclusion of positive, hopeful and holistic stories of reintegration and recovery.Third, with regards to PTSD, over 60% focused on danger, crime or violence (with most of these related to the Lionel Desmond inquest); while only around 1 in 3 focused on recovery, rehabilitation, or health/social service intervention. Moreover, the majority of articles about PTSD simultaneously discussed some aspect of suicide. These results overlap with studies elsewhere indicating that media coverage of PTSD often focuses on crime and violence, with fewer articles on recovery or rehabilitation [18] [19""]","The Mindset guidelines for responsible reporting of mental health and suicide include recommendations such as not going into details about the method used, providing help-seeking information, striving to include quotes from those affected or others like them, and not reinforcing stereotypes. The Canadian media articles about Veterans generally follow these guidelines, with high levels of adherence to the recommendations.","The Mindset guidelines for responsible reporting of mental health and suicide include recommendations such as not going into details about the method used, telling others considering suicide how they can get help, striving to include quotes from those affected, and not reinforcing stereotypes.

As shown in Figure 4 (d), ELISA detection of monocyte culture supernatant showed a similar result. Our findings indicated that C5a enhanced IL-1β release from CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes in MPE C5a plays a role in the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, adhesion, and EMT of lung cancer cellsTo investigate the role of C5a in the progression of MPE, we first evaluated the effects of C5a on the proliferation of A549 cells. As indicated by Ki-67 expression levels and the CCK-8 assay, C5a subsantially promoted A549 cell proliferation, while C5aRA suppressed it ( Figure 5(a),(b) ). By western blot, we further found that C5a caused a significant increase in the levels of p-AKT and PI3K expression, and this effect could be inhibited by C5aRA (Figure 5(c) ). The PI3K inhibitor LY29f4002 resulted in a decrease in Ki-67-positive A549 cells and a lower proliferation index than C5a treatment alone ( Figure 5(d) ,(e)).As flow cytometry and Western blot results indicated, neither C5a nor C5aRA exerted a significant effect on the Figure 5 (h),(i), the apoptosis of A549 cells and the protein levels of cleaved-Caspase 3 and Bax were significantly decreased in the C5a + DDP group, while they were elevated in the C5aRA + DDP group, and C5a could reverse the increase in apoptosis caused by C5aRA.We then sought to investigate whether C5a was involved in the regulation of tumor cell migration and invasion. As soon as 24 h after wounding, C5a showed promoting effects on A549 wound closure ( Figure 5(j) ). Unexpectedly, incubation with C5aRA alone had no effects on A549 migration, while it was harmful to C5a-enhanced A549 cell wound healing ( Figure 5(j) ). As expected, the addition of C5a strongly promoted tumor invasion activity. Although the addition of C5aRA alone did not affect this invasion activity, it significantly suppressed the invasion activity increased by C5a (Figure 5(k) ).The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) was significantly elevated after C5a treatment, which could be abolished by the addition of C5aRA ( Figure 5(l) ). An adhesion assay further confirmed that a significant number of A549 cells adhered to the PMC monolayer within 24 h. As expected, C5a strongly enhanced adhesion, while C5aRA abrogated the enhanced adhesion activity of tumor cells and PMCs ( Figure 5(m) ). Moreover, Western blot results demonstrated that the levels of N-cadherin and vimentin, markers of mesenchymal cells, were significantly increased in C5a-treated A549 cells, whereas the expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial cell marker, was severely decreased. Our results also indicated that C5aRA had the opposite effect on EMT in A549 cells as C5a (Figure 5(n) ).As shown in Figure 6(a),(b) , Ki-67 expression and the proliferation index of A549 cells were increased in the presence of IL-1β, and this effect was dramatically inhibited by the IL-1R antagonist (IL-1RA). The MAPK pathway is the bestknown signaling pathway in the development of cancer and regulates important cellular processes such as proliferation. We then assessed the protein levels of MAPK and p-MAPK in treated A549 cells and found that IL-1β treatment resulted in a significant increase in the levels of MAPK and (Figure 6(c) ). Our data showed that apoptosis was significantly lower in IL-1β-treated cells than in untreated control cells, while the IL-1β receptor antagonist significantly stimulated the apoptosis of A549 cells (Figure 6(d) ,(e)).As the wound-healing assay showed, there was a significant decline in A549 migration in the IL-1RA group compared to the control group after 36 h (Figure 6(f) ). As the transwell assay showed, in the presence of IL-1β, tumor invasion activity was promoted, while the addition of IL-1RA significantly prevented the increase in invasion capability caused by IL-1β (Figure 6(g) ).In addition, IL-1β significantly induced ICAM-1 expression in lung cancer cells, and this effect was abolished by the addition of IL-1']","The apoptosis of A549 cells and the protein levels of cleaved-Caspase 3 and Bax were significantly decreased in the C5a + DDP group, while they were elevated in the C5aRA + DDP group, and C5a could reverse the increase in apoptosis caused by C5aRA.","In the C5aRA + DDP group, C5aRA significantly increased apoptosis in A549 cells.

103,"""What potential therapeutic tools could be used to treat COVID-19 based on clinical studies and meta-analyses?""","[' clinical improvement in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.The same overall conclusions were reported by a metaanalysis, 161 which examined two databases for RCTs in hospitalized patients, where patients were assigned to JAKi or standard of care. Pooling data from 4 such trials with 1338 subjects and treatment with either baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib and nezulcitinib. Treatment with a JAKi led to a significant reduction in the risk of COVID-19 death by 43%. 161 Although these meta-analyses provide a positive image on the efficacy of JAKi in COVID-19, there are several weaknesses. There is redundancy in the studies interrogated. Head-to-head comparisons of different inhibitors in similar settings was not performed. In addition, lack of systematic information on the timing of start of treatment and the variability of simultaneous glucocorticoid treatment further complicate interpretation.There are known adverse effects of the JAKi, which have been described in phase 3 clinical trials with ruxolitinib in MF and PV and then observed for other JAK2 inhibitors. [162] [163] [164] Given that JAK2 is essential for formation of red blood cells and platelets, anemia and thrombocytopenia can be induced by the use of JAK2 inhibitors. [162] [163] [164] In addition, given the involvement of JAKs in the immune response especially via IFNγ, reactivation of latent herpes simplex, zona-zoster, hepatitis B infections and tuberculosis are well known potential adverse effects. Several patients treated for MPNs with ruxolitinib developed aggressive B cell lymphomas. 165 Given that the timeframe of administration of JAKi is rather short (less than 30 days) in COVID-19 the expectation is that the effects reported after long-term use will not be detected.Several JAKi are being investigated for potential thrombotic risk. 166 This is apparently the case for tofacitinib and upacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor). 166 This issue is of great relevance given the thrombotic risk of COVID-19. Also, baricitinib should be examined for potential thrombotic risk. 167 In September 2021, FDA issued an updated warning about increased risk of serious heart-related events, cancer, bloot clots and death for JAKi that treat certain chronic inflammatory conditions. 168 This warning is based on a review of a large randomized safety clinical trial involving tofacitinib, but the warning has been extended to other JAKi treating such chronic inflammatory condition, such as baricitinib and upacitinib. This warning may not be relevant for treatment with JAKi in COVID-19 due to the short treatment duration, while the safety trial concerned chronic longer exposure to JAKi.A couple of potential adverse effects of JAKi including cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, as well as toxicity of combinations including JAKi have been reviewed in. 169 The coadministration, of either baricitinib or ruxolitinib, along with IL-6 inhibitors (eg, tocilizumab, siltuximab) could produce additive immunosuppression with possible severe bacterial or fungal infections. Ruxolitinib inhibits colchicine metabolism and this is relevant in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Favipiravir may enhance baricitinib exposure. In contrast, no adverse effects have been reported for simultaneous use of JAKi and remdesivir or dexamethasone.Although the pandemic situation seems to wear-off in western countries and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have led to limiting hospitalisations, predicting the future evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human population is difficult. Many questions remain concerning new outbreaks, evolution of the virus or how long protection following natural infection or vaccination will last. Therefore, the potential for drugs to treat people suffering from COVID-19 remains of interest.The major targets for inhibition in COVID-19 are the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunopathological phenomena triggered by the delayed cytokine storm inducing lung pathology and ARDS. Since cytokines act via JAKs, JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitors may emerge as potential useful therapeutic tools in the COVID-19 pathology. A JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib also inhibits the Numb Associated Kinase AAK1, which is involved in endocytosis of the virus. Hence baricitinib would act both via inhibiting the immunopathology and inflammation due to JAK1/JAK2 inhibition, but also via direct inhibition of virus entry and assembly due to AAK1 inhibition. Positive results from the doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled ACCT-2 and COV-', ""BARRIER trials led to the FDA recommendation of baricitinib in certain settings of COVID-19 and its recommendation in U.S. NIH practice guideline for treatment of COVID-19. The same conclusison were reached by the expert committee of the WHO that recommends baricitinib in severe and criticial COVID-19 since the eighth version of its 'living guideline on drugs for COVID-19' from January 2022. Second, the JAK2 and JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib also got recommended by the U.S. NIH in case of baricitinib unavailability. However other alternative exists, such as IL-6 receptor blockers, which should be used in priority according to latest WHO guidelines.Ruxolitinib is the oldest JAKi on the market and the only one used in the hematological setting. It is often used in the treatment of MF and certain PV patients, and it was shown that on SARS-CoV-2 infection the inhibitor is generally not stopped and should be continued to control the MPN. It has been suggested that ruxolitinib may reduce immunopathological reactions as it does for GVHd. Although small non-controlled studies suggested some benefit for ruxolitinib in the treatment of COVID-19 and meta-analyses suggested a positive effect, the two randomized phase 3 studies failed to meet their primary endpoints, which led to suspension of ruxoltinib development program in the setting of COVID-19. The different outcomes between these RCTs and smaller studies point to the complexity of conducting clinical studies in patients with COVID-19. The outcomes may have been affected by differences in standards of care at different sites and in different regions at different times during the course of the pandemic. These standards of care include varying proportions of patients receiving corticosteroids, which has been shown to affect the outcomes for hospitalized patients. The studies also enrolled patients at different stages of COVID-19 and patients with more advanced disease may respond better to JAKi. Differences in outcomes between ruxolitinib and baricitinib in different studies may also reflect the doses used.The results on JAKi clinical use analyzed in several meta-analyses and in the studies detailed above suggest but do not prove a role for JAKi in COVID-19, as the only robust data are for an inhibitor that also exerts other effects than JAKi. Better designed trials with precisely controlled time of introduction of JAKi will be critical in the future. A favorable action of JAKi would be predicted by the mechanistic understanding of the COVID-19 immunopathology involving cytokines that require JAK1 for signaling. However, robust clinical confirmation is still needed. In principle, JAKi can be envisaged at times of development of cytokine storm but should not be used too early in COVID-19, as type I IFN signaling requires JAK1. Careful timing is required since pathological secretion of IL-6/IL-1 may occur in the same time-frame with the requirement for type I IFN action to clear the virus, and therefore JAKi may need to be associated with antiviral molecules.As more molecules keep being approved in emergency for treatment of COVID-19, RCTs are important to compare their definitive effect and determine the best indication(s) for each molecule. Also, RCTs with combination therapies would be all the more important for patient who might be already on treatment with JAKiwhich it might be dangerous to stop abruptly in an emergency situation.More data will emerge on secondary effects of JAKi in the setting of COVID-19. For example, both JAKi and COVID-19 were linked to potential thrombotic risk of their own but no evidence to date exist for an increased thrombotic risk while using JAKi for treating COVID-19. Moreover, adverse effects known from long-term treatment with JAKi, as immunosuppression, are less likely to be relevant in COVID-19, where treatment is of short duration, but should be kept in mind.Contributors SC, PG, PL and GL planned, wrote and reviewed review.Funding Funding to SC is acknowledged from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Fondation contre le cancer, Salus Sanguinis and Fondation 'Les avions de Sébastien', projects Action de recherché concertée (ARC) 16/21-073 and""]","JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitors, IL-6 receptor blockers","Based on the provided context, potential therapeutic tools that have shown promise in treating COVID-19 based on clinical studies and meta-analyses include repurposed drugs like remdesivir and dexamethasone, as well as convalescent plasma transfer.

La investigación ha asociado repetidamente niveles más altos de TEPT-C con niveles más altos de DVPM. Resumir las DVPM en factores derivados empíricamente podría facilitar una mayor comprensión de su interacción con la presentación de síntomas dentro de distintos grupos de TEPT-C. Objetivo: El presente estudio tuvo como objetivo investigar subgrupos homogéneos de TEPT-C según la CIE-11 y su asociación con variables demográficas, experiencias traumáticas y factores derivados empíricamente de DVPM. Método: Dentro de un estudio controlado aleatorizado (ECA), se evaluaron TEPT-C, DVPM y experiencias traumáticas en una muestra de 93 pacientes, refugiados afganos y solicitantes de asilo, a través de una entrevista cara a cara totalmente estructurada y asistida por un intérprete utilizando el ITQ, el PMLDC y una lista de verificación de traumas. Se investigaron los grupos subyacentes de TEPT-C, los factores superiores de DVPM y sus asociaciones. Resultados: En total, el 19,4% de la muestra cumplió los criterios de diagnóstico de TEPT y el 49,5% de TEPT-C. Identificamos 2 grupos que constan de dos subgrupos distintos: (1) un grupo de TEPTC y (2) un grupo de TEPT. Las distintas DVPM se resumieron en cuatro factores superiores. La pertenencia al grupo de TEPT-C se asoció con tipos de experienciasSince the 1980s, ongoing and renewed conflicts, human rights violations, and unstable security conditions have forced numerous individuals to flee from Afghanistan. As the third most common country of origin, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) recorded around 2.7 million Afghan refugees recognized under international law, and 0.3 million asylum seekers currently awaiting legal recognition, in 2019 (UNHCR, 2020) . Compared to refugee populations from other countries of origin in Austria, Afghans report particularly low health (Georges, Buber-Ennser, Rengs, Kohlenberger, & Doblhammer, 2021) . Prolonged, repeated, and/or interpersonal traumatic experiences in the country of origin or during flight are highly prevalent among refugees (Bogic, Njoku, & Priebe, 2015) , with between 40 and 90% reporting at least one traumatic experience, depending on the sample and location (Scoglio & Salhi, 2020) . Thus the diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), introduced in the ICD-11, is especially suitable to capture the more far-reaching psychological consequences following complex trauma. In addition to traumatic experiences, it is important to consider post-migration living difficulties (PMLDs) in Austria in order to understand better the mental health problems in refugees. However, it is not yet clear how CPTSD and PMLDs relate to one another.Traumatic exposure has been shown to severely impact mental health (Bogic et al., 2015; Cloitre et al., 2009) . In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the influence of the multiple, heterogeneous stressors associated with facing a foreign country, language, and culture following migration on mental health (Hynie, 2018; Li, Liddell, & Nickerson, 2016)', ""fitting model, including a CPTSD cluster with a very high level across all symptoms and a PTSD cluster with increased PTSD symptoms and difficulties calming down. While the most commonly reported outcomes in studies examining CPTSD patterns were 3-and 4-subgroups (Brewin et al., 2017) , one previous study in a treatment-seeking refugee sample identified the 2 subgroups as the bestfitting solution (Barbieri et al., 2019) .To address the second aim, the items of the PMLDC were subsumed into four factors, characterizing the domains of discrimination & socio-economic living conditions, family concerns, language acquisition & barriers, and residence insecurity. In previous studies, PMLDs associated with the asylum process and family concerns yielded separate factors (Laban et al., 2005; Silove, Steel, McGorry, & Mohan, 1998) , while discrimination (Laban et al., 2005) and language (von Haumeder et al., 2019) were not consistently identified as separate domains. In contrast to Silove et al. (1998) , discrimination and language resulted in two separate factors in our study, but discrimination formed a separate factor together with the frequently reported factor of socioeconomic life conditions (Laban et al., 2005) .Finally, in line with the third aim of the study, we examined the association of gender, traumatic experiences in childhood, discrimination & socio-economical living conditions, and difficulties in language acquisition & barriers with CPTSD cluster membership.Consistent with previous studies (Cloitre et al., 2019; Palic et al., 2016) , traumatic experiences in childhood were associated with the CPTSD cluster membership, whereas traumatic experiences in adulthood were not associated with the CPTSD cluster. Developmental theories emphasize that children and adults have to accomplish various developmental tasks at different time points. Traumatic experiences can hinder successful mastery of these tasks, such as the development of affect regulation skills, secure attachment, or a stable, positive self-concept (Cloitre et al., 2009) . Due to the overlap of DSO with other mental disorders, we assume that the CPTSD class reflects a group of highly distressed individuals with further psychopathology. This might lead to an increased sensitivity to new stressors (Glaser, Van Os, Portegijs, & Myin-Germeys, 2006) , interfere with the processing of prior traumatic experiences, or hamper the subsequent handling of PMLDs (Nickerson et al., 2015) .Our results indicate that not all forms of PMLDs are equally related to the CPTSD cluster: Only the PMLD factor language acquisition & barriers showed an association. Language is a crucial tool for adapting to a new environment and connecting with people. Language skills support the fulfilment of basic needs and adaptive coping with PMLDs, and foster the understanding of current situations (von Haumeder et al., 2019) . Overall, few studies have examined the relationship between language skills and trauma sequelae. Preliminary results showed that difficulties in acquiring the host language mediated the effect between traumatic experiences and PTSD (Kartal et al., 2019) .While our results do not allow for conclusions regarding directionality, we assume a bidirectional relationship between CPTSD symptoms and the associated PMLD factor, language acquisition & barriers. A reciprocal influence between CPTSD symptoms and PMLD factors could lead to a downward spiral of elevated CPTSD symptoms, increased distress caused by PMLDs, and greater difficulties in handling the mental disorder and PMLDs. For example, difficulties in language acquisition, language barriers, and CPTSD symptoms such as associated affective dysregulation, re-experiencing symptoms and deficits in social skills might not only increase the risk of experiencing overwhelming situations but also reduce the possibilities to actively cope with those, which in turn could lead to increased emotional distress. Affective dysregulation might result in a more intense response to emotional cues and increased difficulty in calming down. In the long term, these experiences of difficulties in language acquisition and repeated confrontation with language barriers as well as associated dependency on others, might lead to increased CPTSD symptomatology, such as further deterioration of the negative self-concept, more difficulties in relationships, or social withdrawal. These dynamics and cognitive deficits associated with CPTSD (Etkin, Gyurak, & O'Hara, 2013) may further complicate language acquisition. In turn, the resulting problems in everyday life may increase the risk of social exclusion, and aggravate mental health problems (Kartal et al., 2019) . Additionally, low trust in the health care system can impede access to health care services (Ben, Cormack, Harris, & Paradies, 2017) .The major strength of the present study lies in the investigation of the research questions in an extremely psychologically strained, hard-to-reach population of refugees and asylum seekers. The face-to-face, interpreter-assisted, fully structured interview conducted by a trained clinical psychologist allowed for the participation of illiterate individuals and enabled the""]","The factors that contribute to the relationship between complex PTSD and post-migration difficulties in traumatized refugees and asylum seekers, particularly regarding language acquisition and barriers, are traumatic experiences, discrimination & socio-economic living conditions, and difficulties in language acquisition & barriers.","The factors that contribute to the relationship between complex PTSD (CPTSD) and post-migration living difficulties (PMLDs) in traumatized refugees and asylum seekers, specifically regarding language acquisition and barriers, include the following:

1. **Language Acquisition & Barriers**: The study found that difficulties in language acquisition and language barriers were significantly associated with CPTSD symptoms. Language is crucial for adapting to a new environment, connecting with people, fulfilling basic needs, and coping with PMLDs. Challenges in acquiring the host language can mediate the effect between traumatic experiences and PTSD, leading to increased emotional distress and difficulties in handling both CPTSD symptoms and PMLDs.

2. **Reciprocal Influence**: There is a bidirectional relationship between CPTSD symptoms and language acquisition & barriers. This reciprocal influence can create a downward spiral of elevated CPTSD symptoms, increased distress from PMLDs, and greater challenges in managing both mental health issues and post-migration difficulties. For example, difficulties in language acquisition and barriers can exacerbate CPTSD symptoms like affective dysregulation, re-experiencing symptoms, and social skill deficits, leading to a cycle of emotional distress and impaired coping mechanisms.

3. **Complications and Cognitive Deficits**: The dynamics and cognitive deficits associated with CPTSD may further complicate language acquisition. Problems in everyday life due to language barriers can increase the risk of social exclusion, worsen mental health problems, and contribute to a negative self-concept, relationship difficulties, and social withdrawal.

In summary, difficulties in language acquisition and barriers play a significant role in the relationship between CPTSD and post-migration living difficulties in traumatized refugees and asylum seekers.

116,"What computational methodologies have been used to study antibiotics' binding modes and export mechanisms in efflux pumps, and how have they been applied to design inhibitors and understand antibacterial compounds' efflux liability?","[' states (access/loose, binding/tight, and the third has extrusion/open conformations) of the transport cycle [31] [32] [33] . These structures revealed that drugs are exported by a three-step rotating mechanism in which substrates undergo a sequentially ordered binding before being subjected to efflux into the extracellular milieu. These asymmetric trimer structures also facilitated the modeled arrangement of AcrA and TolC and their interaction with AcrB 34, 35 . The substrate-binding modes and involvement of essential amino acid residues that participate dynamically in the efflux mechanism were also identified [36] [37] [38] [39] . Computational methodologies, like molecular docking and MD simulations methods, exploited this structural data to build the binding modes of antibiotics and decipher their export mechanisms 40, 41 . The tMD (targeted molecular dynamics) simulations technique was able to link the drug-bound peristaltic movement and the associated conformational changes in the trimeric efflux pump [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . The crystal structure and computational models were used to design several potent inhibitors which hinder the conformational changes and thereby defy drug efflux [48] [49] [50] . We have also utilized this structural information to understand binding modes and interaction patterns of novel antibacterial compounds with AcrB, which provided clues to chemical modifications and thereby mitigate the efflux liability 51 . Recent developments in cryo-electron microscopy (EM) in solving multi-subunit complex to its atomic details represents a paradigmshift in understanding the complexities of these sophisticated pumps 23 .The phylogenetic tree of various characterized efflux pumps indicates that they are clustered closer to each other in different clades. The pump OqxB, which is known for its ability to expel a broad variety of substrates, is seen to belong to a separate and structurally unexplored clade as compared to previously characterized proteins such as AcrB, MexB, TriC, and AdeB, which are known to lie in different clusters ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). In addition, recent observations indicate that OqxB seems to play a decisive role in other Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Salmonella spp. due to its mobilization through horizontal gene transfer 26 . This qualifies it as a prime candidate for a detailed structural-functional analysis and studies its role in efflux.Here, we report the crystal structure of the K. pneumoniae OqxB efflux pump with DDM molecules bound in its substratebinding pocket. We have further utilized this structure to identify the key amino acids contributing to the efflux of fluoroquinolones. We further assess its efflux propensity through systematic gene complementation and biochemical evaluations. We believe that this work will lead to a better understanding of the contribution of OqxB transporters and provide clues to address the threat posed by OqxB dependent efflux liability.Crystal structure of the OqxB. OqxB from K. pneumoniae was purified and its crystal structure was solved at 1.85 Å resolution. (PDB ID: 7CZ9, Supplementary Table S1 ). The asymmetric unit contains six OqxB monomers/protomers and each monomer is composed of 1040 residues. The overall fold of the trimer is similar to other published HAE1 sub-family of RND class of efflux pumps such as AcrB and MexB. Each OqxB monomer contains 12 trans-membrane (TM) helices (TM1 to TM12). The large periplasmic domain of the OqxB protomer that emerges from the inner membrane is connected through two extracellular loops that link TM1 with TM2 and TM7 with TM8 (Fig. 1A) . The six individual protomers (Fig. 1B) are structurally similar with main chain atoms RMSD of less than 0.8 Å (Supplementary 37 .

87,What is the role of the HN molecule in producing antibodies for genotype 2.VII strains of NDV?,"[' indirect immunoperoxidase test to visualize specific reactivity [25] . Having the advantage that already staining pattern in this test may give an indication whether MAbs are directed to outer glycoproteins, the test depends on manual inspection of the plates and is more difficult to standardize; in addition, use of formalin may denature sensitive epitopes. To be able to use ELISA technique for high throughput screening, investigators have used antibody-or poly L-lysine-coated plates to capture and thereby preserve the conformation of a viral protein [56, 57] . Our test system relied on the lectin properties of ConA as an anchor for the antigen, a system previously shown to preserve conformational epitopes of viral glycoproteins [42, 43] . By using a genotype 2.VI specific monoclonal antibody that is highly reactive by HI [46] , we could demonstrate that the ConA-ELISA preserves NDV epitopes sensitive to receptor blocking. Applying the Con-A-ELISA for screening of the initial hybridoma supernatants and subsequent cloning, we obtained six MAb that were reactive by ELISA and HI, and all six clones could be confirmed by IFT. However, none of the six HI-positive MAb were reactive by WB, which is in line with previous studies that denaturing WB conditions destroyed the conformation of HI sensitive epitopes of the HN molecule. Overall, comparing ELISA reactivity to HI titers, it became apparent that ConA-ELISA was far more sensitive producing titers of well above 1:3200, whereas the highest HI titer was 1:256 (8 log 2 ) but without a direct correlation between the two values. It is striking that the MAb with the lowest HI titer (5C2) had comparable or even higher ELISA reactivity than the other MAbs. The ConA-ELISA, in addition, was able to present strain specific epitopes, as five out of six HI-positive MAbs reacted only with NDV genotype 2.VII strain NR730 but not with the vaccine strain clone 30, genotype 2.II, by HI. Thus, using HN-enriched virus preparation in conjunction with ConA-ELISA system that preserves conformational epitopes proved to be efficient to produce specific MAbs that are suitable to identify biologically relevant targets in specific NDV genotypes.In order to investigate the putative conservation of HIsensitive epitopes of HN proteins of ND viruses of different genotypes we extended the analysis to cross-reactivity using NDV strains representing distantly related class 1 NDV as well as seven additional class 2 genotype viruses. Only MAb 4E11 was reactive with all 8 different NDV genotypes tested, including the class 1 strain. On the other hand, the majority of HN specific MAbs predominantly reacted with the homologous NDV strain NR730, although within this group of MAbs three distinct reactivity profiles were discernable: (a) MAb 5C2 showed residual cross-reactivity to three other genotypes, (b) three MAbs (5C9, 5D1, 7C12) reacted specifically with two different genotype 2.VII strains, and (c) MAb 7A8 differentiated between the two genotype 2.VII viruses. This points, in summary, to a high degree of flexibility of some HI epitopes, whereas other epitopes seem to be very well preserved. This is corroborated by observations derived from structural analysis of the HN molecule: Crenell and colleagues found that MAbs could interfere with receptor binding, even though the target was not the receptor binding pocket itself [52] . In consequence such sites might not be crucial for the function of the molecule and are allowed to have more structural flexibility. Intrinsic properties of antibodies targeting these sites might then influence the specificity of the reaction, i.e. antibodies with high affinity might be able to bind a broader spectrum of virus strains. On the other hand, epitopes adjacent to or directly at the receptor binding site are part of functionally pivotal structures and have to stay conserved. These epitopes would represent conserved antigenic sites across the genotypes as recognized by the MAb 4E11 which showed HI and neutralization activity. In the viral HN antigen used for immunizing the mice, both types of sites were apparently immunogenic. Considering the number of obtained MAb, i.e. five strain specific versus one MAb specific for a conserved site, the variable sites might have been more immunogenic for mice. In contrast, polyclonal antibody preparations revealed only minor antigenic differences, indicating a balanced presentation of conserved and strain-/genotype-specific antigenic sites for chickens. In consequence polyclonal sera are of limited value when addressing variability of antigenic sites. On the other hand, polyclonal sera raised after immunization of chickens are capable']",The HN molecule is used to produce antibodies for genotype 2.VII strains of NDV.,"The HN molecule plays a crucial role in producing antibodies for genotype 2.VII strains of NDV by containing specific epitopes that can be targeted by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs).

Data were then epoched, based on the onset of the visual grating, into segments of 1.5s pre-and 1.5s post-stimulus onset. To avoid edge artefacts during time-frequency decomposition, an additional 2.5s of data on either side of these timepoints was included as \'padding\'. MEG channels containing large amounts of artefactual data were identified by visual inspection (a maximum of ten channels, per participant, were removed).Trials containing artefacts (SQUID jumps, eye-blinks, head movement) were removed by visual inspection. After pre-processing, there was an average of 109.7 trials (SD=9.1) for the VSS group and 117.4 trials for the control group (SD=2.3). Finally, data were down-sampled to 300Hz to speed computation.As structural MRI scans were not available for all participants, we adopted an alternative approach for MEG-MRI co-registration. The digitised head-shape data were matched with a database of 95 structural MRIs from the human connectome database, 42 using an iterative closest points (ICP) algorithm. The head shape-MRI pair with the lowest ICP error was then used as a \'pseudo-MRI\' for subsequent steps. This procedure has been shown to improve source localisation performance in situations where a subject-specific anatomic MRI is not available. 43, 44 The aligned MRI-MEG image was used to create a forward model based on a single-shell description of the inner surface of the skull. 45 In SPM12, a nonlinear spatial normalisation procedure was used to construct a volumetric grid (8mm resolution) registered to the canonical MNI brain.Source analysis was conducted using a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer, 46 which applies a spatial filter to the MEG data at each point of the 8mm grid. Based on recommendations for optimising MEG beamforming, 47 a regularisation parameter of lambda 5% was used. Beamformer weights were calculated by combining lead-field information with a sensor-level covariance matrix averaged across data from baseline and grating periods. Data were bandpass filtered between 40-70Hz (gamma) and 8-13Hz (alpha), and source analysis was performed separately. To capture induced rather than evoked visual power, a period of 0.3-1.5s following stimulus onset was compared with a 1.2s baseline period (1.5-0.3s before grating onset).To analyse changes in oscillatory power and PAC further, we defined a region of interest in the calcarine sulcus using the AAL atlas, 48 which overlaps with visual area V1. This ROI was chosen based on previous MEG and intracranial recordings, 29, 38, 49, 50 which has established V1 as the primary cortical generator of gamma oscillations following the presentation of visual grating stimuli. For each participant, we selected the grid-point within the calcarine sulcus (parcel names: Calcarine_L; Calcarine_R), which showed the greatest change in gamma power versus baseline. The sensor-level data was then multiplied by the spatial filter from this grid-point to obtain a V1 ""virtual electrode"".For the gamma band, oscillatory power was calculated using a multi-taper approach, 51 from 40-70Hz, using a 0.5s time window, sliding in steps of 0.02s and ±7Hz frequency smoothing. To check whether our results were driven by group differences in baseline power, for each subject, we averaged oscillatory power, as calculated in the previous section, between 1.5s to 0.3s before stimulus onset and 40-70Hz.Time courses from our ROI data were examined for changes in alpha-gamma phaseamplitude coupling (PAC).

121,"""What is the impact of the multiplex detection method on cytokine measurement in CRS-causing viruses and its relation to the number of cytokines measured in studies of different viruses?""","[' we first assessed how comparable the number of different cytokines measured in these studies was across the five CRS-causing viruses. Figure 2 shows how variable this number is between virus-specific studies (e.g., 15 for H5N1 and 26 for SARS-CoV-2). This variation reflects (i) the increasing interest developed for CRS-causing pathologies over recent years (26 recent studies reported cytokine measurement for SARS-CoV-2 against only 10 H5N1-related studies) and (ii) the increased availability and sensitivity of the multiplex detection method.The influenza A viruses trigger an increase in all cytokine levels measured (Figure 2 , yellow). In contrast, during infection with each of the β-coronaviruses, some cytokines were detected at levels normally found in control groups (blue). This indicates that β-coronaviruses can subvert the immune response, reflecting different kinetics and pathogenesis between the influenzaand coronavirus-associated diseases. Of note, studies of H5N1 infections showed that a few cytokines were increased compared with control groups, and no change was observed in other studies (36, 52) , illustrating the greater complexity of these diseases, probably due to the multifactorial nature of the mechanisms involved. Table 1 shows the number of cytokines whose levels are increasing in one, two, three, four or all five virus-related infections from the interrogated literature. Only five cytokines were modulated regardless of the virus-associated disease concerned, with 20 other cytokines being shared to some degree. Increased levels observed in 16 cytokines were unique to a single virus at a time. It is important to keep in mind that the amplitude of change in the cytokines is not considered, which can be different between the different diseases, adding to the heterogeneity of those severe respiratory infectious diseases. This backs up the highly complex nature of the associated diseases as well as the past and current struggles to develop efficient vaccines and treatments.To examine the presence of the measured cytokines and directionality of their change, we constructed a heatmap of the included viruses and cytokine responses.The Cytokine Response to SARS-CoV-2 Sits in Between the Ones Given to Other β-coronaviruses and Influenza A VirusesWe used a hierarchic clustering algorithm on the viruses using Jaccard distance and complete linkage, clustering them based on the cytokine responses they cause. The method groups the pathogens in three clusters. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV comprise the coronavirus cluster, and H5N1 and H7N9 form the influenza cluster, while SARS-CoV-2 sits in an individual cluster (Figure 3) , slightly closer to the two influenza A viruses than to the two β-coronaviruses.The cluster analysis of cytokines defines eight clusters, based on the direction of their modulation upon infection with each virus. It is important to note that the results of this cluster analysis are biased by the missing information for some cytokines. Bearing this in mind, it is worth looking into the detailed patterns of cytokine responses of the various CRS-inducing viruses. The cytokine cluster I includes the pro-inflammatory, TNF-α, and two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-2 and IL-10. All of them had mixed results in SARS-CoV-2, while encompassing all three categories of results for the other two coronavirus infections, which were predominantly increased during influenza infections. Unfortunately, cluster II seems to be restricted to cytokines measured only in H7N9-mediated infections, preventing us from comparing influenza A viruses vs. with β-coronaviruses. Clusters III and VI carry the generally increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are elevated for almost all of the viruses but not measured in all of the cases of cluster VI. Among those cytokines are IFN-α and IFN-γ, typical representatives of the general antiviral response (type-I and type-II IFNs), as well as IL-6, one of the most prominent pro-inflammatory cytokines, along various chemokines. Cytokines from Cluster IV measured during coronavirus infections do not fluctuate, while most of them are elevated during an influenza infection, e.g., IL-4 and IL-5 upon H7N9 infections. IL-4 is involved in Th2 differentiation, and the Th2 cells can produce IL-5 to mitigate eosinophil infiltration (53) . Such differences observed between virus-specific pathologies reflect the strong alterations observed in coronavirus infections, particularly SARS-CoV-2 (54) . The cytokines in Cluster VII and VIII do not always respond to SARS-CoV-2: IL-15 and CCL5 (RANTES) are not elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The survival of this individual may have been down to extraordinary luck, but the use of antibacterial plants may well have saved them. There is abundant evidence for dental problems throughout the archeological record and attempts at treating these currently represent the earliest evidence for invasive medical treatment. From Homo habilis (2.4-1.6 million years) onwards, there are many examples of interproximal grooves, or deep scratches in teeth that have been interpreted as evidence for tooth picking (Ungar et al. 2001; Gracia-Téllez et al. 2013; Lozano et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2014) .

188,How can the history of papillomaviruses be determined based on sequence information and phylogenetic trees?,"[' Villiers et al., 2004) . Presumed HPV types that are only identified by partial PCR amplicons do not qualify as a numbered type, but are described with an abbreviation identifying the laboratory of origin (e.g. LVX100, for Luisa Villa X100 (de Villiers et al., 2004) . All sequence information about papillomaviruses is not only available through central databases like GenBank, but also, in an annotated form in a special database that is publicly available on the internet (HPV Sequence Data Base; Farmer et al., 1995) .The term ""subtypes"" was used in the 1980s to identify isolates of HPV types with divergent restriction patterns. Subsequently, this term became redefined as referring to an isolate whose L1 sequence is 2-10% different from that of any known type. A consequence of this redefinition was that the traditional subtypes (e.g. HPV-6a, HPV-6b and HPV-6c) had to be eliminated, as they showed less than 2% sequence diversity. Surprisingly, today only three HPV isolates are known that fulfill this subtype definition. HPV-46, HPV-55, HPV-64 had been originally described as separate types, but their type status has now been cancelled, as they are subtypes of HPV-20, HPV-44, and HPV-34, respectively (de Villiers et al., 2004) . It remains a mystery of academic interest why ""subtype"" genomes, which once must have existed in the process of evolution, are today apparently virtually absent.""Variants"" of HPV types differ by about 2% of the original isolate, which is in this context referred to as ""prototype"" or ""reference genome"", while the new variants can be designated by arbitrary abbreviations. In order to identify a variant, one typically sequences a small part of the HPV genome, for example 400 bp of the long control region or the 450 bp of the E6 gene, and calls a variant every isolate that differs from the prototype by at least one nucleotide. This strategy has been applied to numerous HPV types (Ho et al., 1993; Ong et al., 1993; Heinzel et al., 1995; Stewart et al., 1996; Yamada et al., 1997; Chan et al., 1997) from isolates throughout the world. The two principal observations from these studies were that (i) there is apparently only a limited number (for example 20-100) of common variants of each HPV type, and (ii) that variants showed maximal divergence when they were sampled from ethnic groups that evolved for a long time without contact, for example Africans and American Indians. From this, one has to conclude that each HPV type was with the human species since our origins, and evolved and spread together with the infected cohort (Bernard, 1994) . There was never a time or an ethnic group without common warts, genital warts, and cervical cancer, and HPVs did not infect humans from an animal reservoir such as some other viruses, like HIV-1, Ebola, the SARS coronavirus, or influenza. There are indications that variants of the same HPV type differ biologically and etiologically (Xi et al., 1998; Villa et al., 2000) . Such differences may contribute to the disparities in the incidence of cervical cancer throughout the world, although this question still requires substantial research before conclusions can be drawn (Calleja-Macias et al., 2004) .Modern taxonomy aims to understand the relationship of biological objects such as viruses based on their evolutionary history rather than on phenotypic characteristics. This concept is relevant for HPVs, since unexpectedly, it was found that different HPV types associated with similar lesions are sometimes only very distantly related to one another. For example, HPV-1, HPV-2, HPV-4 and HPV-41 are all found in wart-like cutaneous lesions, but are on remote branches of evolutionary trees. HPV-16 and HPV-18, the two HPV types that have become paradigms in the research on cervical carcinogenesis, are less related to one another than to some HPV types that are never found in cervical malignancies. Sequence studies showed that groupings originally based on pathology (""genital HPVs"" such as HPV-16) contained, based on sequence similarity, closely related HPV types that occurred in cutaneous lesions, such as HPV-2. Research in numerous laboratories over the last decade confirmed that the sequence comparison of whole papillomavirus genomes, individual genes or even short segments of genes leads to phylogenetic trees that summarize the evolutionary history of papillomaviruses as a prerequisite to establish taxonomic groups . A complete list and the taxonomic relationship of all known and completely described papillomaviruses together with a phylogenetic tree that shows the relationship of all papillomavirus types, species, and genera can be accessed in a recent publication from de Villiers et al.

71,What is the target of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine?,"['To appear in: Vaccine\nSARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 has emerged as a pandemic with all continents now reporting cases, most of them community acquired [1] . Many COVID-19 infections cause pneumonia and some are fatal, predominantly among older adults [2] . Co-infection with other viruses or bacteria, particularly those that similarly cause inflammation of the respiratory tract would likely enhance the risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Such disease enhancing coinfections have been frequently reported for respiratory pathogens [3] [4] [5] , most notably so for the 1918 influenza pandemic [6, 7] . Vaccinating older adults at elevated risk of severe COVID-19 disease against vaccine preventable diseases may therefore not only help to reduce the strain on the healthcare system from those diseases during a pandemic, but also alleviate some of the potential COVID-19 mortality due to co-infecting pathogens [8] .Vaccines that can prevent respiratory tract infections in adults and particularly in older adults, either through direct protection or indirectly through high coverage childhood immunisation programmes, include vaccines against seasonal influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, measles, Bordetella pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Measles, pertussis and Hib vaccines are already included in almost all routine infant immunisation programmes globally and have largely eliminated the targeted pathogens as a risk to the older adult population through indirect protection [9] . Hence, they have limited scope for use in older adults in order to limit COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), either 10-or 13-valent, is used in three-quarters of routine infant immunisation programs globally; in countries that use PCV, the burden of adult pneumococcal disease due to PCV serotypes has also substantially decreased [10] . These considerations mean there is a relatively small preventable disease burden in countries routinely using PCV in children. As vaccine costs are relatively high and there is no current World Health Organisation recommendation regarding PCV use in adults, PCVs are not considered further here. Two vaccines that target a large burden of the remaining respiratory disease in older adults are seasonal influenza vaccines and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23). These vaccines are only included in routine adult immunisation in some countries and even there with only moderate coverage [11] .We conducted a non-systematic review of the published, pre-print and grey literature to evaluate whether vaccination of older adults with seasonal influenza vaccine or PPV23 could help reduce COVID-19 mortality.The World Health Organization recommends seasonal influenza vaccine use for pregnant women as well as older adults (>65yrs), health care workers and persons with specific chronic illnesses (particularly HIV) [12] . In 2014, 45% of countries globally had established a seasonal influenza vaccine programme that targets older adults, hardly any of them are in low or middle income countries [13] .Seasonal influenza as a risk factor for COVID-19 could be an important consideration in tropical climates and the southern hemisphere, and potentially during future waves of COVID-19 in the northern hemisphere [14] [15] [16] . Inactivated influenza vaccine effectiveness varies markedly by season from about 20% in seasons with a poor match to the circulating strains to up to 60% for closer matched seasons [17, 18] . Hence, influenza vaccination could prevent 20% to 60% of influenza infections and thereby potentially a similar percentage of influenza-attributable COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Table 1) .A number of studies to date have tried to assess the percentage of influenza-attributable COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Some reported the occurrence of co-infection of COVID-19 inpatients with influenza viruses, although the proportion of co-infections varies by study, from no influenza coinfection identified to more than 60% of PCR positive COVID-19 patients being currently or having been recently infected with influenza [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Whether this co-occurrence is co-incidental, or indeed influenza contributes to the clinical severity of COVID-19 presentation is not yet clear. However, to date there is no evidence that would suggest clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients with influenza co-infection differ from those without co-infection [19] .PPV23 targets 23 of the over 90 serotypes that are responsible for most adult pneumococcal disease. In countries with an infant PCV program, about 48-66% of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in older adults is caused by serotypes that PPV23 is effective against [26] ; in countries without an infant PCV programme this percentage is likely about 20% higher (details see Appendix). PPV23 is recommended for routine use in older adults']",The target of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is 23 of the over 90 serotypes that are responsible for most adult pneumococcal disease.,The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) targets 23 of the over 90 serotypes that are responsible for most adult pneumococcal disease.,What is the target of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine? ->: The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) targets 23 of the over 90 serotypes that are responsible for most adult pneumococcal disease.,"

106,"What's the relationship between AUC of anti-RBD IgG and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, considering data from infected and uninfected participants?","[' to understand antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. Thirty-four subjects (18.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, or had known recent close contacts but were not tested due to early limited testing availability. Those diagnosed with COVID-19 were separated into two groups, those infected in March 2020 (14 people) and those infected in the second wave of infections starting in July 2020 (20 people). Data concerning the local COVID-19 outbreak is publicly available: https://www.healthygallatin.org/coronaviruscovid-19/, accessed on 31 May 2021. Ten out of the remaining 134 participants were not diagnosed with COVID-19 and had no known contacts, yet had detectable antibody titers. Participants indicated their disease severity on a scale of 0-3 from asymptomatic to severe. The breakdown of antibody detection and disease severity of these participants is presented in Table 1 . We determined that most volunteers with unknown COVID-19 diagnosis or interactions (124/134 or 92.5%) were negative for COVID-19 antibodies. Twenty-seven people included in our study self-reported an illness in the 6-month period prior to antibody testing; of these only 4 had IgG AUC levels above the cutoff. Thus, despite many being anecdotally ""sure"" that they had contracted the virus in January or February before COVID-19 was detected and testing was available regionally, most were anti-RBD IgG negative. Clearly, in addition to COVID-19, there were severe cold strains and flu circulating in our community early in 2020. Our small surveillance study determined that a person with no known exposure or diagnosis was very unlikely to have COVID-19 antibodies.The majority of participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had detectible IgG titers (85.3%, 29/34 people). Thus, a small fraction (14.7%, 5/34) of confirmed positive COVID-19 diagnosed participants did not have detectible IgG levels. The mismatch between COVID-19 diagnosis and antibody titers occurred for the first time in August 2020 and then occurred four more times during the increase in COVID-19 cases in our county in the fall of 2020. Furthermore, the AUCs for these people were far below the cutoff. These data suggest either an increased detection of asymptomatic confirmed positive participants that failed to elicit detectible antibody responses or the possibility of increasing misdiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection that occurred during the increase in testing in the fall of 2020. Volunteers with positive ELISA titers were invited to donate serum samples monthly for up to 12 months post-infection, regardless of their COVID-19 diagnosis. RBD-specific antibodies were measured more than once in most participants and were maintained in the majority of participants for 5 months when detection began to wane, with only about 50% of subjects maintaining antibody titers for more than 6 months (Figure 2A,B) . Of the 15 people that had antibody assessments monthly for greater than 6 months, only 6 had antibody titers that lasted longer than 6 months. Clearly, those participants with sera collections starting in July lost antibody titers sooner and thus were assessed for a much shorter duration. Alternatively, a few of the individuals with detectible titers did not return for sampling. There were no notable differences in self-reported disease severities between those infected in March, compared to those infected in July or later. Too few ill participants were enrolled to generate a correlation between disease severity and antibody levels. We measured the highest starting titers in participants that were infected in March and found a strong correlation between antibody levels detected initially and the duration of the measurable antibody response ( Figure 2C ). Infections that occurred in July or after resulted in significantly lower starting antibody levels ( Figure 2D ). Expanded testing and contact tracing at this later time may have increased the diagnosis of more very mild or asymptomatic infections compared to March. The IgG AUC of participants with no known infection or interaction also appeared lower but was not significantly different from the other groups.We measured the capacity for collected sera to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 for both those infected in March ( Figure 3A ) and those infected in July and after ( Figure 3B ). These assays were performed in BSL-3 containment with serum samples that were not inactivated with 1% Triton-X100 and the neutralization titers are reported as the inverse of the serum dilution that provided 50% protection of the monolayer. There was a correlation between anti-RBD IgG AUC and the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3C) . Thus, the results suggest that anti-RBD IgG AUC is a valid predictor of the capacity of serum to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, confirming the findings in earlier studies [15, 26] . However, serum from one', ' subject was below the cutoff for anti-RBD-IgG but retained the capacity to neutralize the virus (Table 1) . Further investigation of this phenomenon is warranted.We originally hypothesized that testing somewhat random volunteers would help to reveal the extent of asymptomatic infection. While most participants without known COVID-19 diagnosis or close contact were antibody negative, we detected RBD-specific antibodies in 10 participants that had no known interactions or close contacts with confirmed COVID-19 patients ( Figure 4A ). Of these 10, all but two had no or very mild symptoms. The two participants that reported severe symptoms had either a negative COVID-19 test or the symptoms that occurred well before COVID-19 had been locally detected. These ten participants were assessed over time, and all but two had antibody AUCs that were Vaccines 2021, 9, 587 6 of 12 considered positive upon repeated measures. Although antibodies were measurable by ELISA, only two of these 10 had long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. In one case, these titers were maintained for more than 6 months ( Figure 4B ). While there are multiple studies concerning antibodies following hospitalization or confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, not many studies have assessed antibody levels in people who are undiagnosed with COVID-19. This small subset of ELISA-positive participants without known diagnosis underscores the fact that antibody titers in the absence of known COVID-19 contacts or diagnosis are likely very low and non-neutralizing. We measured the capacity for collected sera to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 for both those infected in March ( Figure 3A ) and those infected in July and after ( Figure 3B ). These assays were performed in BSL-3 containment with serum samples that were not inactivated with 1% Triton-X100 and the neutralization titers are reported as the inverse of the serum dilution that provided 50% protection of the monolayer.

There was a statistical difference between antibody levels from people diagnosed in March compared to those diagnosed in July or after. * p < 0.05 as determined by Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunns post-test.The generation of variable antibody levels depending on infectious dose can be modeled in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Lacking the viral receptor, wild type mice do not become infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas transgenic mice expressing hACE2 demonstrate measurable symptomatic responses [27] . We compared antibody responses after infection with 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 in transgenic hACE-2 mice. Mice were infected with 10 4 or 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal route. Most mice expressing hACE2 developed measurable neutralizing antibodies after only 6 days of infection, whereas the wild type mice did not ( Figure 4C ). The hACE2 mice infected with the higher dose generally developed slightly higher antibody titers and more severe symptoms of disease (morbidity) than those receiving the lower dose ( Figure 4D ). However, some hACE2 mice did not respond to infection and this variation between animals precluded significance. There are many caveats to the interpretation of these experiments and any conclusions on how reflective they might be of responses in humans should be tempered. However, the data We originally hypothesized that testing somewhat random volunteers would help to reveal the extent of asymptomatic infection.

102,What factors contribute to increased risk of cross-contamination and bloodstream infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients in a single-centre ICU?,"["" period required rapid operational changes that can significantly challenge the ability of healthcare staff to respect fully the usual infection control practices aimed at reducing the patient-topatient transmission of pathogens that frequently contaminate a hospital environment. For example, during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, Yap et al (3) observed an increase in methicillin-resistant S. aureus acquisition in the ICU and suggested that the excessive use of gloves (especially when worn together with long-sleeved gowns) may have contributed to reducing compliance to hand hygiene and the advised practice of changing gloves and cleansing hands before and after each contact with a patient, and between caring for dirty and clean body-sites in the same patient.A careful reassessment of the infection control procedures adopted in our ICU during the emergency phase of the pandemic revealed two major critical issues that may have increased the risk of cross contamination: there was a shortage of sterile gowns during the first 7 days of the epidemic and the two-bedded rooms were equipped with only one medical cart. Medical charts are prone to surface contamination, since they are handled by physicians, nurses, and other medical staff several times a day. In specific, medical carts are considered high-touch surfaces accounting for a median of three touches per operator's interaction (28) .It is also worth noting that our usual practice of screening patients for MDR microorganisms upon admission and putting possibly colonized/infected patients in preventive isolation could not be fully implemented during the study period, because the ICU was rapidly overwhelmed and there were only three single rooms that could be used for isolation purposes. At the same time, the antimicrobial stewardship service provided by infectious diseases specialists had to be reduced. It is, therefore, possible that the combination of all of these factors played a role in favoring episodes of cross-contamination that eventually increased the number of bacteramia episodes in our extremely fragile population.In particular, our finding that a high percentage (83.7%) of patients who developed Enterococcus bacteremia had stayed in the same room for overlapping periods or within few weeks suggests that the degree of nosocomial transmission might have been relevant.Unfortunately, we could not extend our genotyping analysis to all of the Enterococcus species isolates in order to verify the hypothesis of a point source outbreak, because local policy requires only the routine collection and storage of MDR organisms for the purposes of microbiological surveillance. However, the results of our genotyping analyses of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains collected from five patients whose intubation periods overlapped support the view that cross-transmission may have accounted for only some of the observed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus-related BSIs.Finally, another possible explanation for the unexpectedly high frequency of BSIs due to Enterococcus species may be the disruption of the gut barrier caused by SARS-CoV-2. As it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 productively infects human gut enterocytes (29) , it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, which is a known risk factor for the development of BSIs. Pathologic studies are needed to shed light on the possible enteric barrier damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 such as that previously found to be associated with SARS-CoV-1 (30) .Our study has a number of limitations. First, its single-centre design and the evolving nature of the setting limit the generalizability of the findings; however, we believe that our findings can be generalized to other contexts and settings in which an unexpectedly high flow of critically ill COVID-19 patients exceeds the capacity of healthcare facilities (31) . Second, the lack of comparative data (historical or from other hospital settings) makes it difficult to ascertain how much weight should be given to SARS-CoV-2 infection itself or the organizational changes in explaining the observed increase in the frequency of BSIs. In particular, the available evidence concerning BSI episodes in critically ill patients is representative of quite different settings that were not overwhelmed by the surge of the pandemic (i.e., low-threshold ICU admissions involving a smaller percentage of mechanically ventilated patients). Third, the conduction of a prospective study with the collection of microbiological samples was not feasible due to the contingency of the pandemic. Thus, the retrospective design of the study made it impossible to genotype all of the Enterococcus species strains and only the MDR strains collected for surveillance purposes were available to test the hypothesis of between-patient cross-contamination. Finally, the high short-term mortality rate and small sample size prevented us from assessing the impact of the BSIs on in-ICU mortality (18) .An abrupt surge in the number of critically ill COVID-19 patients seems to have a detrimental effect on the frequency of ICU-acquired BSIs (particularly Enterococcus-""]","The factors that contribute to increased risk of cross-contamination and bloodstream infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients in a single-centre ICU include shortage of sterile gowns, lack of medical carts, inability to fully implement isolation measures, reduced antimicrobial stewardship service, and disruption of the gut barrier caused by SARS-CoV-2.","The factors contributing to an increased risk of cross-contamination and bloodstream infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients in a single-centre ICU include:
